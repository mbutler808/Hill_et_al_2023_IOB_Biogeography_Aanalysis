- models: directory where the outputs of the models are stored; mainly .csv and .rds files of the raw BioGeoBEARS output and 
	- `modelfit.csv` table containing dAIC, Lnl, df, disperal, and extinction rates for all of the models. 
	- `hyp_fits.rds` a list of all of the model-fits from BioGeoBEARS
- Figures: 
	- h_DEC.pdf the pie plot phyogeny output from BioGeoBEARS
	- Fig4_DEC.pdf: plot of phylogeny with ancestral terranes produced by best DEC fit model
	- Fig5_plot.pdf: central data plot of figure 5, put together with maps and annotations in illustrator. This plot shows the timing of the inferred dispersal events with error bars for the nodes at which range transitions occur.
