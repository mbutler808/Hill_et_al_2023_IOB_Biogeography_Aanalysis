@article{McGuire:2023,
	abstract = {{The biota of Sulawesi is noted for its high degree of endemism and for its substantial levels of in situ biological diversification. While the island's long period of isolation and dynamic tectonic history have been implicated as drivers of regional diversification, this has rarely been tested in the context of an explicit geological framework. Here we provide a tectonically-informed biogeographical framework that we use to explore the diversification history of Sulawesi flying lizards (the Draco lineatus Group), a radiation that is endemic to Sulawesi and its surrounding islands. We employ a framework for inferring cryptic speciation that involves phylogeographic and genetic clustering analyses as a means of identifying potential species followed by population demographic assessment of divergence-timing and rates of bi-directional migration as means of confirming lineage independence (and thus species status). Using this approach, phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of mitochondrial sequence data obtained for 613 samples, a 50-SNP data set for 370 samples, and a 1249-locus exon-capture data set for 106 samples indicate that the current taxonomy substantially understates the true number of Sulawesi Draco species, that both cryptic and arrested speciation have taken place, and that ancient hybridization confounds phylogenetic analyses that do not explicitly account for reticulation. The Draco lineatus Group appears to comprise 15 species -- nine on Sulawesi proper and six on peripheral islands. The common ancestor of this group colonized Sulawesi ~11 Ma when proto-Sulawesi was likely composed of two ancestral islands, and began to radiate ~6 Ma as new islands formed and were colonized via overwater dispersal. The enlargement and amalgamation of many of these proto-islands into modern Sulawesi, especially during the past 3 Ma, set in motion dynamic species interactions as once-isolated lineages came into secondary contact, some of which resulted in lineage merger, and others surviving to the present.}},

@article{Brown:2015,
	abstract = {{We present a near comprehensive, densely sampled, multilocus phylogenetic estimate of species relationships within the anuran family Ceratobatrachidae, a morphologically and ecologically diverse group of frogs from the island archipelagos of Southeast Asia and the South-West Pacific. Ceratobatrachid frogs consist of three clades: a small clade of enigmatic, primarily high-elevation, semi-aquatic Sundaland species currently assigned to Ingerana (for which we erect a new genus), which is the sister taxon of two large, monophyletic radiations, each situated on islands on either side of Wallace's Line. One radiation is composed of Philippine species of Platymantis and the other contains all taxa from the eastern Indonesian, New Guinean, Solomon, Bismarck, and Fijian archipelagos. Several additional genera (Batrachylodes, Discodeles, Ceratobatrachus, and Palmatorappia) are nested within Platymantis, and of these Batrachylodes and Discodeles are nonmonophyletic. To address the widespread paraphyly of the genus Platymantis and several additional nomenclatural issues, we undertook a wholesale nomenclatural reorganization of the family. Given our partially unresolved phylogeny, and in order to impart a conservative, stable taxonomy, involving a minimal number of genus-species couplet changes, we propose a conservative classification representing a few compromises. These changes are designed to preserve maximally the presumed original intent of taxonomy (widely used group names associated with morphological and ecological diversity of particular species or groups of species) while implementing a hierarchical system that is consistent with the estimate of phylogeny based on new molecular data.}},

	abstract = {Oreophryne presently represents the second-most-diverse genus of microhylid frogs, with 57 named species, most occurring on New Guinea and its satellite islands. Nonetheless, a diversity of species remains to be described. Using morphological, color-pattern, and advertisement-call data, I describe ten new species of Oreophryne from the Papuan Peninsula of New Guinea and adjacent islands, which together form the East Papuan Composite Terrane. All but two of these species can be placed into two species groups based on call type. I refer to these species groups as the O. anser group and the O. equus group, both being based on species described herein. Members of the O. anser group produce calls reminiscent of a goose honk, whereas members of the O. equus group produce calls reminiscent of a horse's whinny. Description of three new species in the O. anser group requires me to first rediagnose O. loriae, which has previously been interpreted as including the frogs named herein as O. anser sp. nov. The honk call type has not previously been reported within Oreophryne, and the whinny call may be novel as well, although it is possibly derived from other New Guinean species having calls consisting of a slower series of peeps. Based on their unique call types, I hypothesize that both species groups are monophyletic. If true, each would appear endemic to the East Papuan Composite Terrane. Only five additional species of Oreophryne are known from this region that do not belong to one or the other of these two species groups; hence, these newly identified species groups represent the majority of diversity in Oreophryne from the Papuan Peninsula and its satellite islands.},

This ontogenetic change, uniform peach adult coloration, and blue iris all appear to be unique features within the genus Oreophryne, most of whose members are tan, brown, or gray.

@article{Kraus:2021,
	abstract = {The Milne Bay Region of southeasternmost Papua New Guinea comprises a small portion of mainland New Guinea and several offshore islands, totaling 15,000 km2 in land area. I numerically summarize the literature and findings from my field surveys of the region's herpetofauna and show that it contains the greatest known assemblage of range-restricted endemic herpetofauna globally for such a small area. Further, most of these species occupy only one or two of 11 small areas of local endemism within the region. I compare the number and density of endemic herpetofauna in the Milne Bay Region to other regions of notable endemic biodiversity and find it to be far larger than that in the large majority of these other "hotspots", despite the much larger sizes of those areas. Herpetofaunal surveys within the Milne Bay Region are more complete than for other taxa, but it is clear that this region holds a large trove of range-restricted endemic species within less well-studied groups too. The driver of this endemic diversity is the ongoing geological dismemberment and uplift of the region resulting from the opening of the Woodlark Rift. Prior ignorance of the biodiversity importance of this region stems from decades of classifying New Guinea as a "tropical wilderness area", which has deprived that region of the conservation focus accorded the more famous "hotspots". One effect of this is that some of the areas of local endemism identified here are under immediate pressure for habitat conversion, especially Woodlark Island, which is threatened by both mining and virtually complete conversion to oil palm, posing a high extinction risk for scores of endemic species.},

@article{Heaney:2000,
	abstract = {Abstract 1 The equilibrium model of island biogeography developed in the 1960s by MacArthur and Wilson has provided an excellent framework in which to investigate the dynamics of species richness in island and island-like systems. It is comparable in many respects to the Hardy--Weinberg equilibrium model used in genetics as the basis for defining a point of reference, thus allowing one to discover the factors that prevent equilibrium from being achieved. Hundreds of studies have used the model effectively, especially those dealing with brief spans of time and limited geographical areas. In spite of this utility, however, there are important limitations to the MacArthur--Wilson model, especially when we consider long-term and large-scale circumstances. 2 Although their general theory is more complex, the MacArthur--Wilson equilibrium model treats colonization and extinction as the only two processes that are relevant to determining species richness. However, it is likely that phylogenetic diversification (phylogenesis) often takes place on the same time-scale as colonization and extinction; for example, colonization, extinction, and phylogenesis among mammals on oceanic and/or old land-bridge islands in South-east Asia are all measured in units of time in the range of 10 000--1 million years, most often in units of 100 000 years. 3 Phylogenesis is not a process that can be treated simply as `another form of colonization', as it behaves differently than colonization. It interacts in a complex manner with both colonization and extinction, and can generate patterns of species richness almost independently of the other two processes. In addition, contrary to the implication of the MacArthur--Wilson model, extinction does not drive species richness in highly isolated archipelagoes (those that receive very few colonists) to progressively lower values; rather, phylogenesis is a common outcome in such archipelagoes, and species richness rises over time. In some specific instances, phylogenesis may have produced an average of 14 times as many species as direct colonization, and perhaps 36 species from one such colonization event. Old, stable, large archipelagoes should typically support not just endemic species but endemic clades, and the total number of species and the size of the endemic clades should increase with age of the archipelago. 4 The existence of long-term equilibrium in actual island archipelagoes is unlikely. The land masses that make up island archipelagoes are intrinsically unstable because the geological processes that cause their formation are dynamic, and substantial changes can occur (under some circumstances) on a time-scale comparable to the processes of colonization, phylogenesis, and extinction. Large-scale island-like archipelagoes on continents also are unstable, in the medium term because of global climatic fluctuations, and in the long term because of the geologically ephemeral existence of, for example, individual mountain ranges. 5 Examples of these phenomena using the mammals of South-east Asia, especially the Philippines, make it clear that the best conceptual model of the long-term dynamics of species richness in island archipelagoes would be one in which colonization, extinction, and phylogenesis are recognized to be of equivalent conceptual importance. Furthermore, we should expect species richness to be always in a dynamic state of disequilibrium due to the constantly changing geological/geographical circumstances in which that diversity exists, always a step or two out of phase with the constantly changing equilibrium point for species richness.},

I suggest that different types of islands be ecologically defined on the basis of processes relative to which some ecologically interesting entities on those `islands' actually are isolated from their surroundings. Four main island scales can be discerned, namely, the scales of (1) individuals, (2) population dynamics, (3) population differentiation, and (4) evolutionary divergence. I illustrate these different island types and their interfaces with examples mainly from northwestern Europe. The equilibrium hypothesis seems relevant primarily on the population dynamics scale. A research programme following such differentiation would include two phases: first, assessment of factors which make the environment studied `insular', and second, construction of specific models for analysing ecological processes in those particular insular conditions.},

	abstract = {{Species richness of six pasture arthropod assemblages (total arthropod species, total herbivore species, sucking and chewing herbivores, total predatory species and spiders) were regressed against several geographical variables (area, distance from the nearest mainland, maximum elevation and geological age of the islands) of three Azorean islands (S. Maria, Terceira and Pico). The species were sampled by the fixed-quadrat size sampling method and the results obtained are consistent with the geological age hypothesis, i.e. the species richness of the six indigenous arthropod assemblages increases with the geological age of the islands, both at local and regional scales. Higher values of indigenous and endemic species richness were consistendy found on the older island (S. Maria), and the lowest values on the most recent island (Pico). Moreover, when considering the age of Faial (an older island probably once connected with Pico) as a estimate of the age of Pico, correlations between species richness and island age were improved, thereby strengthening the relationship. The older island (S. Maria) has more specialized herbivores and a greater proportion of herbivores in relation to predatory arthropods. Ecological and biogeographical studies in the Azores should take into account the effects of the time each island has been available for colonization and evolution.}},

@article{Cowie:1995,
	abstract = {The native land-snail fauna of the Hawaiian islands was investigated from a combined perspective of ecological and historical, vicariant, and dispersalist biogeography. There were more than 750 described, valid species; almost all were endemic to the archipelago, many to single islands. Path analysis showed that island area, per se, had the strongest influence on numbers of species. Island altitude and number of plant communities, both strongly related to area and both dimensions of habitat diversity, also had major influences. The influence of island age was complex. A direct effect, older islands having more species, was more than counterbalanced by the strong indirect effects of age on area and altitude: older islands are smaller and lower, and smaller, lower islands had fewer species. Distance of an island from a source of colonization was of minor importance. Species richness thus appears to be related almost exclusively to evolutionary radiation in situ and not to an equilibrium between immigration and extinction. Islands need not be extremely isolated for evolutionary radiation to be more important than immigration/extinction dynamics in determining species richness, but isolation is a relative term dependent on the dispersal abilities of the organisms in question. Numbers of recorded species were also strongly correlated with collecting effort on each island, a result that stands as a warning to others involved in such studies. Numbers of species in different families were not evenly distributed across islands. Notably, Kauai had more amastrids and helicinids and fewer achatinellids than predicted; Oahu had more amastrids but fewer pupillids and succineids than predicted; Hawaii exhibited the opposite pattern from Oahu. These patterns may partly reflect the vagaries of collecting/describing effort, but some may be due to the combined effects of historical factors and competitive exclusion. The distribution of shell height/diameter was bimodal with a distinct absence of more or less equidimensional species, a general pattern seen in other faunas. Among the pulmonates, tall species predominated, suggesting a relative lack of opportunity for globular/flat species. Notably, amastrids occurred in both modes, evidence that, at least in part, ecological not taxonomic factors underlie the bimodality. The proportions of tall and globular/flat species did not vary among islands. Prosobranchs were mostly low-spired but generally less flat than the pulmonates in the low-spired mode. The islands were probably colonized originally by small taxa. Large, tall shells are found only on Kauai and Niihau, the oldest of the main islands, suggesting that opportunities for such species are probably available on other islands.},

@article{Whittaker:2008,
	abstract = {Abstract Aim  MacArthur and Wilson's dynamic equilibrium model of island biogeography provides a powerful framework for understanding the ecological processes acting on insular populations. However, their model is known to be less successful when applied to systems and processes operating on evolutionary and geological timescales. Here, we present a general dynamic model (GDM) of oceanic island biogeography that aims to provide a general explanation of biodiversity patterns through describing the relationships between fundamental biogeographical processes -- speciation, immigration, extinction -- through time and in relation to island ontogeny. Location  Analyses are presented for the Azores, Canaries, Gal{\'a}pagos, Marquesas and Hawaii. Methods  We develop a theoretical argument from first principles using a series of graphical models to convey key properties and mechanisms involved in the GDM. Based on the premises (1) that emergent properties of island biotas are a function of rates of immigration, speciation and extinction, (2) that evolutionary dynamics predominate in large, remote islands, and (3) that oceanic islands are relatively short-lived landmasses showing a characteristic humped trend in carrying capacity (via island area, topographic variation, etc.) over their life span, we derive a series of predictions concerning biotic properties of oceanic islands. We test a subset of these predictions using regression analyses based largely on data sets for native species and single-island endemics (SIEs) for particular taxa from each archipelago, and using maximum island age estimates from the literature. The empirical analyses test the power of a simple model of diversity derived from the GDM: the log(Area) + Time + Time2 model (ATT2), relative to other simpler time and area models, using several diversity metrics. Results  The ATT2 model provides a more satisfactory explanation than the alternative models evaluated (for example the standard diversity--area models) in that it fits a higher proportion of the data sets tested, although it is not always the most parsimonious solution. Main conclusions  The theoretical model developed herein is based on the key dynamic biological processes (migration, speciation, extinction) combined with a simple but general representation of the life cycle of oceanic islands, providing a framework for explaining patterns of biodiversity, endemism and diversification on a range of oceanic archipelagos. The properties and predictions derived from the model are shown to be broadly supported (1) by the empirical analyses presented, and (2) with reference to previous phylogenetic, ecological and geological studies.},

We report the discovery of coesite in late Miocene eclogite from the lower plate of one of the D'Entrecasteaux Islands metamorphic core complexes within the Woodlark Rift. Zircon crystallization temperatures (650--675 $\,^{\circ}$C) and 238U/206Pb age (ca. 8 Ma), and rutile thermometry (695--743 $\,^{\circ}$C) combined with garnet-pyroxene thermometry (600--760 $\,^{\circ}$C) and garnet-pyroxene-phengite barometry (18--27 kbar), indicate that the coesite-eclogite was exhumed from mantle depths (≥90 km) to the Earth's surface at plate tectonic rates (cm yr−1). This late Miocene coesite-eclogite is the youngest exhumed ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) rock on Earth, and its preservation ahead of the westward-propagating seafloor spreading center forces reevaluation of models for UHP exhumation, as well as the geologic and tectonic evolution of the Woodlark Rift.}},

@article{Zirakparvar:2013,
	abstract = {Geochemical, isotopic, and geochronologic data for exhumed rocks in the Woodlark Rift of Papua New Guinea (PNG) allow a tectonic link to be established with the Late Cretaceous Whitsunday Volcanic Province (WVP) of northeastern Australia. Most of the metamorphic rocks in the Woodlark Rift have Nd isotopic compositions (εNd=+1.7 to +6.2) similar to the Nd isotopic compositions of rocks in the WVP (εNd=+1.3 to +6.6; Ewart et al., 1992), and contain inherited zircons with 90 to 100Ma U--Pb ages that overlap the timing of magmatism in the WVP. None of the metamorphic rocks in the Woodlark Rift have the highly evolved Hf and Nd isotopic compositions expected of ancient continental crust. Magmas were erupted in the WVP during the middle Cretaceous as eastern Gondwana was rifted apart. The protoliths of felsic and intermediate metamorphic rocks in the Woodlark Rift are interpreted to be related to the magmatic products produced during this Cretaceous rifting event. Some mafic metamorphic rocks exposed in the western Woodlark Rift (eclogites and amphibolites) are not related to the WVP and instead could have originated as basaltic lavas crystallized from mantle melts at (U)HP depths in the Late Cenozoic, or as fragments of Mesozoic aged oceanic lithosphere. Isotopic and elemental comparisons between basement gneisses and Quaternary felsic volcanic rocks demonstrate that felsic lavas in the D'Entrecasteaux Islands did not form solely from partial melting of metamorphic rocks during exhumation. Instead, the isotopic compositions and geochemistry of Quaternary felsic volcanic rocks indicate a significant contribution from the partial melting of the mantle in this region. When combined with geophysical data for the western Woodlark Rift, this suggests that future seafloor spreading will commence south of Fergusson Island, and west of the present-day active seafloor spreading rift tip.},

	abstract = {Abstract--- The biogeography of the cicadas of the Indo-Pacific is discussed in relation to paleogeography and compared with distribution patterns found in other groups of organisms. The cicadas show a low degree of endemism in the mainland of southeast Asia and the Greater Sunda Islands, and a high degree of endemism in Sulawesi, New Guinea, and the islands of the west Pacific. The biogeography of the cicadas of these regions with high endemism is analyzed for four groups: the subtribe Cosmopsaltriaria, the tribe Prasiini, the genus Baeturia, and the Pacific Cryptotympanini. A review of the paleogeography of the Indo-Pacific, specifying the relevant barriers, island arcs, and land connections, is provided. The recognized areas of endemism are tentatively related to the geological history of the Indo-Pacific. Areas of endemism are the Sulawesi Arcs and the Outer and Inner Melanesian Arcs. New Guinea appears to be a composite of areas of different origin: the central mountains of the Inner Melanesian Arc, the north-coast mountains of the Outer Melanesian Arc, and the Vogelkop area, which is of uncertain origin. The Papuan Peninsula of New Guinea seems to be a zone of overlap between the Outer and the Inner Melanesian Arcs. The Pacific archipelagos of the Outer Melanesian Arcs (viz., the Bismarck Archipelago, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and the Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa Islands) represent distinct areas of endemism. The taxon-area cladogram of the Cosmopsaltriaria gives some indication of the relationships among the areas of endemism. The discussion is extended to groups of bats, frogs, psocids, butterflies, and moths of the Melanesian Arcs, as their patterns of distribution seem equally relevant for the recognition of the biogeographic interrelationships in the Indo-Pacific.},

	abstract = {Compositionally layered metamorphic rocks of the D'Entrecasteaux Islands, Papua New Guinea, are folded into domes and antiforms bounded by faults parallel to metamorphic layering and foliation. The structures are broadly similar to the metamorphic ``core complexes'' of western North America. Lenses of ultramafic rock lie on the bounding faults, and the same faults have served as loci for Quaternary andesitic volcanic activity. Metamorphic grade in the northern islands (Goodenough and Fergusson) is amphibolite facies, with pockets of eclogite (Fergusson Island only) and granulite, and is greenschist facies in the southern island (Normanby). In all three islands there is a characteristic tectonostratigraphic sequence (FMU sequence) from felsic metamorphic rocks at base, or internally, through mafic metamorphic rocks to ultramafic rocks at top, or externally. The association of metamorphic and ultramafic rocks apparently developed in a north dipping Paleogene subduction system and was exhumed to upper crustal level in the Oligocene--Early Miocene, possibly by reversal of movement on faults in the former subduction system. Vigorous uplift and development of domes and antiforms in the Pliocene was triggered by westward propagation of the Woodlark Basin spreading ridge and was accompanied by rifting, rift-related magmatism, rapid erosion, and deposition of coarse sediment in the adjacent Trobriand Basin.},

	abstract = { Abstract Woodlark Island, the largest above‐sea portion of the Woodlark Rise, has an exposed basement of pre‐Miocene (?Cretaceous‐Eocene) low‐K tholeiitic basalt and dolerite, and minor sediments. The basement is unconformably overlain by Early Miocene limestone and volcaniclastic sediments and later Miocene high‐K volcanics and comagmatic intrusives. Pleistocene to Recent sediments partly blanket the Tertiary sequence. Basement low‐K tholeiites vary only slightly in composition and are interpreted as ocean floor or possible marginal basin material. The high‐K suite appears to be chemically similar to late Tertiary to Recent high‐K igneous rocks of mainland Papua New Guinea. It includes porphyritic hornblende‐, clinopyroxene‐, biotite‐ and magnetite‐bearing shoshonite, latite and toscanite, and intrusive equivalents that range from olivine normative to strongly quartz normative compositions (S1Q2 46\% to 75\%). Computer mixing models indicate that separation of the pheno‐crysts in the shoshonites, particularly pargasitic hornblende, is a feasible mechanism for producing the more silica‐rich monzonites and latites. The low‐K tholeiitic basement rocks of Woodlark Island are inferred to be part of an ophiolitic slab en echelon with the Papuan Ultramafic Belt, thrust over equivalents of the Cretaceous Owen Stanley Metamorphics or, in part, onto existing oceanic crust. High‐K igneous rocks on Woodlark Island appear to form an eastward extension of a province of calcalkaline to shoshonitic volcanic and intrusive rocks, which stretches from Mount Lamington to the Louisiade Archipelago. Late‐middle Miocene high‐K magmatism at Woodlark Island is consistent with the observation that activity commenced earlier in the E and became progressively younger westwards towards mainland Papua New Guinea. Periodicity in the magmatism was apparently synchronous with major rifting episodes that formed the Woodlark Basin. The data on the Woodlark Island high‐K suite support the currently accepted. concept of delayed partial melting of a mantle source previously modified by the introduction of water and LILE from an earlier subduction zone (Johnson et al., 1978b). },

	abstract = {Aims We aim to document elevational richness patterns of geometrid moths in a globally replicated, multi-gradient setting, and to test general hypotheses on environmental and spatial effects (i. e. productivity, temperature, precipitation, area, mid-domain effect and human habitat disturbance) on these richness patterns. Location Twenty-six elevational gradients world-wide (latitudes 288 S to 518 N). Methods We compiled field datasets on elevational gradients for geometrid moths, a lepidopteran family, and documented richness patterns across each gradient while accounting for local undersampling of richness. Environmental and spatial predictor variables as well as habitat disturbance were used to test various hypotheses. Our analyses comprised two pathways: univariate correlations within gradients, and multivariate modelling on pooled data after correcting for overall variation in richness among different gradients. Results The majority of gradients showed midpeak patterns of richness, irrespective of climate and geographical location. The exclusion of humanaffected sampling plots did not change these patterns. Support for univariate main drivers of richness was generally low, although there was idiosyncratic support for particular predictors on single gradients. Multivariate models, in agreement with univariate results, provided the strongest support for an effect of area-integrated productivity, or alternatively for an elevational area effect. Temperature and the mid-domain effect received support as weaker, modulating covariates, while precipitation-related variables had no explanatory potential. Main conclusions Despite the predicted decreasing diversity-temperature relationship in ectotherms, geometrid moths are similar to ants and salamanders as well as small mammals and ferns in having predominantly their highest diversity at mid-elevations. As in those comparative analyses, single or clear sets of drivers are elusive, but both productivity and area appear to be influential. More comparative elevational studies for various insect taxa are necessary for a more comprehensive understanding of elevational diversity and productivity.},

	abstract = {{Understanding processes that have driven the extraordinary high level of
   biodiversity in the tropics is a long-standing question in biology. Here
   we try to assess whether the large lineage richness found in a New
   Guinean clade of mayflies (Ephemeroptera), namely the Thraulus group
   (Leptophlebiidae) could be associated with the recent orogenic
   processes, by applying a combination of phylogenetic, biogeographic and
   ecological shift analyses. New Guinean representatives of the Thraulus
   group appear monophyletic, with the possible exception of a
   weakly-supported early-diverging clade from the Sunda Islands. Dating
   analyses suggest an Eocene origin of the Thraulus group, predating by
   several million years current knowledge on the origin of other New
   Guinean aquatic organisms. Biogeographic inferences indicate that 27 of
   the 28 inferred dispersals (96.4\%) occurred during the Eocene,
   Oligocene and Miocene, while only one dispersal (3.6\%) took place
   during the Pliocene-Pleistocene. This result contrasts with the higher
   number of altitudinal shifts (15 of 22; 68.2\%) inferred during the
   Pliocene-Pleistocene. Our study illustrates the role played
   by-potentially ecological-diversification along the elevation gradient
   in a time period concomitant with the establishment of high-altitude
   ecological niches, i.e., during orogenesis of the central New Guinean
   mountain range. This process might have taken over the previous main
   mode of diversification at work, characterized by dispersal and
   vicariance, by driving lineage divergence of New Guinean Leptophlebiidae
   across a wide array of habitats along the elevation gradient. Additional
   studies on organisms spanning the same elevation range as Thraulus
   mayflies in the tropics are needed to evaluate the potential role of the
   ecological opportunity or taxon cycles hypotheses in partly explaining
   the latitudinal diversity gradient.}},

	abstract = {The present-day distribution patterns of the cicadas of Wallacea, New Guinea, and the West Pacific reflect the extremely complex geotectonic history of that area. The patterns found in two unrelated monophyletic groups of cicadas (Insecta, Homoptera, Cicadoidea), the subtribe Cosmopsaltriaria and the tribe Chlorocystini with its sister tribe Prasiini, are analysed and related to data from the geological literature. The two groups have a comparable distributional range over Sulawesi, Maluku, New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the East-Melanesian archipelagos, to Tonga and Samoa. The occurrence of endemic species, species groups, and genera in congruently delimited parts of this range made us recognize 14 areas of endemism. The areas of endemism coincide with geological entities, which have been isolated during a considerable period of time. Most of the areas originated from oceanic island arcs, which developed as a result of subduction along the southern and western edges of the Pacific tectonic plate, others are rifted microcontinents. Concentrations of species and especially endemic species of the various cicada genera in different areas of endemism suggest that each of these genera evolved in isolation on one of the afore mentioned geological entities. These entities can therefore be regarded as source areas for the genera. The island are fragmented as a result of collisions first with the Asian- and later with the Australian tectonic plate and several of its parts reamalgamated at the northern craton of the Australian plate, where they now form the greater part of the island of New Guinea. After reamalgamation of the are fragments the cicadas of the respective genera that had evolved on these fragments could disperse into adjoining areas, but since cicadas are poor dispersers the source areas of the genera can still be recognized in present-day distribution patterns. The generic relationships in the two groups of cicadas under study indicate area relationships that comply with the latest palaeogeographic reconstructions. The main vicariant speciation events in the cicada cladograms correspond with the presumed sequences of fragmentation of the island are. Cicada phylogeny and distribution combined reflect the historic area relationships rather than the present ones.},

Analyses objectively and quantitatively showed collection density and biases at 50 km spatial resolution and predict genus richness at 1 km spatial resolution. To model the distribution of 1354 genera presence-only data and the MaxEnt niche model were used. Results showed many cells with fewer than 5 unique genera whereas other cells had upwards of 600 unique genera. Model performance achieved a mean test AUC score of 0.7. The most influential environmental variables were elevation, slope, and temperature annual range. Predicted genus richness increased from south to north across the island and west to east along the central mountain range. Models predicted higher richness in topographically complex regions at higher elevations. Comparatively, lower elevations with homogenous topography had larger tracts of high genus richness. Modeling genus level data supplied baseline information about plant distributions, yet some genera are more speciose than others, so the full scope of richness or endemism may not be captured. Results can be used to prioritize sampling needs, support conservation strategies, compare genus diversity to other regions, and discuss biogeography principles.},

	abstract = {{Sea-level change has been viewed as a primary driver in the formation of
   biodiversity. Early studies confirmed that Plio-Pleistocene sea-level
   changes led to the isolation and subsequent genetic differentiation of
   Southeast (SE) Asian organisms over short geological timescales.
   However, long-time consequences of sea-level fluctuations remain
   unclear. Herein, we analyze the evolutionary history of Althepus
   (spiders) whose distribution encompasses Indo-Burma and the Sunda shelf
   islands to understand how sea-level changes over shallow and deep
   timescales effected their history. Our integrative analyses, including
   phylogeny, divergence times, ancestral area reconstruction and
   diversification dynamics, reveal an intricate pattern of
   diversification, probably triggered by sea-level fluctuations during the
   Paleocene-Eocene and Plio-Pleistocene. The timing of one early
   divergence between the Indo-Burmese and Sundaic species coincides with
   late Paleocene and early Eocene high global sea levels, which induced
   the formation of inland seaways in the Thai-Malay Peninsula. Subsequent
   lowered sea levels could have provided a land bridge for its dispersal
   colonization across the Isthmus of Kra. Analyses suggest that
   Plio-Pleistocene sea-level rises contributed to recent divergence of
   many species. Thus, our findings cannot reject the hypothesis that
   sea-level changes during the Paleocene-Eocene and Plio-Pleistocene
   played a major role in generating biodiversity in SE Asia; sea-level

	abstract = {{The geology of the earth has shown profound changes in the position,
   connectivity and topography of continents during the last 100 Myr, which
   could have shaped the diversification of lineages and thus the current
   distribution of biodiversity. Here, we evaluate the association between
   plate tectonics and the current location of hotspots of endemic richness
   across the globe. We used palaeogeographies in a model that quantifies,
   through time and for each geographic cell, the potential dispersal
   between disconnected habitat areas. We expected that rare dispersal
   events across barriers of unsuitable habitat allow species colonization,
   but a subsequent absence of gene flow could lead to in situ speciation.
   We evaluated whether this process could pinpoint the locations of
   hotspots of endemic richness computed from the ranges of 181 603 species
   across 14 taxonomic groups. The significant spatial congruence between
   the model and the endemic richness of several clades provides evidence
   of the contribution of plate tectonics in shaping global biodiversity
   gradients. The signal of plate tectonics was independent from those of
   the Quaternary glaciation, topographical heterogeneity and contemporary
   productivity and was stronger for terrestrial than freshwater and marine
   taxa. Regions with high tectonic complexity, predominantly located at
   the confluence of major lithospheric plates such as the Mediterranean
   basin, Mesoamerica, Madagascar and South East Asia, probably provided
   favourable circumstances for allopatric speciation and the emergence of
   new species across straits. Further efforts should be made to
   disentangle the effect of past diversification relative to current

	abstract = {Much of the world's insect and plant biodiversity is found in tropical
   and subtropical hotspots', which often include long elevational
   gradients. These gradients may function as diversity pumps' and
   contribute to both regional and local species richness. Climactic
   conditions on such gradients often change rapidly along short vertical
   distances and may result in local adaptation and high levels of
   population genetic structure in plants and insects. We investigated the
   population genetic structure of two species of Ficus (Moraceae) along a
   continuously forested elevational gradient in Papua New Guinea. This
   speciose plant genus is pollinated by tiny, species-specific and highly
   coevolved chalcid wasps (Agaonidae) and represented by at least 73
   species at our study gradient. We present results from two species of
   Ficus sampled from six elevations between 200m and 2700m a.s.l. (almost
   the entire elevational range of the genus) and 10 polymorphic
   microsatellite loci. These results show that strong barriers to gene
   flow exist between 1200m and 1700m a.s.l. Whereas lowland populations
   are panmictic across distances over 70km, montane populations can be
   disjunct over 4km, despite continuous forest cover. We suggest that the
   limited gene flow between populations of these two species of montane
   Ficus may be driven by environmental limitations on pollinator or seed
   dispersal in combination with local adaptation of Ficus populations.
   Such a mechanism may have wider implications for plant and pollinator
   speciation across long and continuously forested elevational gradients
   if generalist insect pollinators and vertebrate seed dispersers also
   form populations based on elevation.},

	abstract = {As lithospheric plates are subducted, rocks are metamorphosed under high-pressure and ultrahigh-pressure conditions to produce eclogites and eclogite facies metamorphic rocks. Because chemical equilibrium is rarely fully achieved, eclogites may preserve in their distinctive mineral assemblages and textures a record of the pressures, temperatures and deformation the rock was subjected to during subduction and subsequent exhumation. Radioactive parent-daughter isotopic variations within minerals reveal the timing of these events. Here we present in situ zircon U/Pb ion microprobe data that dates the timing of eclogite facies metamorphism in eastern Papua New Guinea at 4.3 +/- 0.4 Myr ago, making this the youngest documented eclogite exposed at the Earth's surface. Eclogite exhumation from depths of approximately 75 km was extremely rapid and occurred at plate tectonic rates (cm yr(-1)). The eclogite was exhumed within a portion of the obliquely convergent Australian-Pacific plate boundary zone, in an extending region located west of the Woodlark basin sea floor spreading centre. Such rapid exhumation (> 1 cm yr(-1)) of high-pressure and, we infer, ultrahigh-pressure rocks is facilitated by extension within transient plate boundary zones associated with rapid oblique plate convergence.},

	abstract = {The Woodlark Rift in Papua New Guinea hosts the world's youngest (2--8Ma) eclogite-facies rocks and extensional deformation has played a key role in exhuming these (U)HP rocks at rates of >20mm/yr. During the Eocene Papuan arc-continent collision Australian Plate-derived continental rocks were subducted to (U)HP depths. There they remained for up to 30m.y. until the Pliocene when asthenospheric circulation ahead of the west-propagating Woodlark spreading ridge introduced heat and fluids. This caused rocks to break away from the paleosubduction channel, recrystallize in the eclogite facies, and rise as Rayleigh--Taylor instabilities. The diapirs ascended adiabatically undergoing partial melting, which lowered their viscosity and increased buoyancy. (U)HP crust ponded near the Moho at ~2--4Ma, thickening the crust to ~40km (11kb). Domal uplifts emerged above sea level, and these are still underlain by an unusually thick crust (>26km) for a rift that has stretched by factor of ~3 since 6Ma. After ponding, they acquired a flat-lying foliation during amphibolite-facies retrogression. Vertical shortening accompanied the gravitationally driven outflow of ponded lower crust. The weak material was extended parallel to the rift margin, thinning ductilely by <1/3. The flow was dominated by pure shear (Wk ~0.2), and was mechanically decoupled from -- and orthogonal to -- plate motion in the rift. Top-E shear fabrics suggest that this flow was westward, perhaps driven by isostatic stresses towards a strongly thinned rift corridor ahead of the Woodlark spreading ridge. At <2Ma, the gneisses were upwardly juxtaposed against an ophiolitic upper plate to form nearly symmetric gneiss domes that cooled at >100$\,^{\circ}$C per m.y. and were mechanically incorporated into the rift's upper crust. Final exposure was by normal faulting and minor erosion. Such exhumation may also apply to other (U)HP terranes where less evidence for Moho ponding is preserved.},

	abstract = {Geographical distributions of terrestrial or freshwater taxa that are broken up by oceans can be explained by either oceanic dispersal or vicariance in the form of fragmentation of a previously contiguous landmass. The validation of plate-tectonics theory provided a global vicariance mechanism and, along with cladistic arguments for the primacy of vicariance, helped create a view of oceanic dispersal as a rare phenomenon and an explanation of last resort. Here, I describe recent work that suggests that the importance of oceanic dispersal has been strongly underestimated. In particular, molecular dating of lineage divergences favors oceanic dispersal over tectonic vicariance as an explanation for disjunct distributions in a wide variety of taxa, from frogs to beetles to baobab trees. Other evidence, such as substantial gene flow among island populations of Anolis lizards, also indicates unexpectedly high frequencies of oceanic dispersal. The resurrection of oceanic dispersal is the most striking aspect of a major shift in historical biogeography toward a more even balance between vicariance and dispersal explanations. This new view implies that biotas are more dynamic and have more recent origins than had been thought previously. A high frequency of dispersal also suggests that a fundamental methodological assumption of many biogeographical studies -- that vicariance is a priori a more probable explanation than dispersal -- needs to be re-evaluated and perhaps discarded.},

@article{Vences:2003,
	abstract = { Amphibians are thought to be unable to disperse over ocean barriers because they do not tolerate the osmotic stress of salt water. Their distribution patterns have therefore generally been explained by vicariance biogeography. Here, we present compelling evidence for overseas dispersal of frogs in the Indian Ocean region based on the discovery of two endemic species on Mayotte. This island belongs to the Comoro archipelago, which is entirely volcanic and surrounded by sea depths of more than 3500 m. This constitutes the first observation of endemic amphibians on oceanic islands that did not have any past physical contact to other land masses. The two species of frogs had previously been thought to be non-endemic and introduced from Madagascar, but clearly represent new species based on their morphological and genetic differentiation. They belong to the genera Mantidactylus and Boophis in the family Mantellidae that is otherwise restricted to Madagascar, and are distinguished by morphology and mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences from mantellid species occurring in Madagascar. This discovery permits us to update and test molecular clocks for frogs distributed in this region. The new calibrations are in agreement with previous rate estimates and indicate two further Cenozoic transmarine dispersal events that had previously been interpreted as vicariance: hyperoliid frogs from Africa to Madagascar (Heterixalus) and from Madagascar to the Seychelles islands (Tachycnemis). Our results provide the strongest evidence so far that overseas dispersal of amphibians exists and is no rare exception, although vicariance certainly retains much of its importance in explaining amphibian biogeography. },

	abstract = {{1. The osmotic and ionic regulatory abilities of adults of the euryhaline crab-eating frog (Rana cancrivora) have been studied. Adult frogs tolerated environmental salinities as high as 28‰ at 30$\,^{\circ}$C. Tadpoles of this form tolerated salinities as high as 39\\%‰ at the same temperature.2. Changes in body weight of frogs following transfers to different environmental salinities indicate both that the skin of this frog is permeable to water and that these animals do not swallow large volumes of external medium, even in high salinities.3. Above salinities of about 9\\%‰, plasma Δ rises with increasing environmental Δ. Plasma Δ is always higher than environmental Δ. Increases in plasma concentration above fresh-water levels are due partly to increased NaCl concentration (about 40\\%), partly to increased urea concentration (about 60\\%). Urea concentrations as high as 0.48 M (2.9\\%) have been measured.4. Urinary Δ parallels plasma Δ, but is always lower than plasma Δ. Considerable quantities of urea are lost via the urine, even though urinary urea levels are below plasma levels.5. Measurements of short-circuit current indicate that active uptake by the skin of inorganic ions continues in R. cancrivora acclimatized to high salinities.6. R. cancrivora is no less susceptible to water loss by evaporation from the skin than are other amphibians.7. In preference experiments R. cancrivora chooses salinities below 18\\%‰, but shows no strong preference for a particular salinity.8. Similar observations on osmoregulatory mechanisms in a close relative of R. cancrivora, the tiger frog (R. tigerina), show that the latter species is similar to ordinary fresh-water frogs.9. The striking physiological convergence between R. cancrivora and the elasmo-branch fishes is discussed, as are various possible implications of our data regarding nitrogen metabolism in tadpoles and kidney function in adult frogs.}},

	abstract = {Changes in oceanic radiocarbon (14C) reservoir ages through the deglaciation and Holocene can provide important information on ocean circulation as Earth's climate warmed. Here, we present reservoir ages for the western tropical Pacific that span the mid-Holocene transition from less to more frequent El Ni{\~n}o events. Reservoir ages were calculated using paired U--Th and conventional 14C dating of eight individual fossil coral samples from Koil and Muschu Islands, northern coastal Papua New Guinea (PNG). AMS 14C and MC-ICPMS U--Th dating of additional samples from six of the fossil corals were used to confirm the TIMS U--Th and conventional 14C ages. The combined results show average reservoir ages of 185$\pm$3014Cyr (n=4) for 7220--5850yrBP compared to 42014Cyr for a modern coral from Muschu Island. From 5850 to 5420yrBP reservoir ages increase to modern values. The relatively young reservoir ages from 7220 to 5850yrBP are best explained by greater influx of well-equilibrated sub-tropical water from the southern branch of the South Equatorial Current (SEC). This is consistent with strengthening trade winds (facilitating air--sea exchange) and a more northerly position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone thought to have occurred at this time. The transition to more modern-like reservoir ages from 5850 to 5420yrBP suggests modern oceanic circulation patterns were established during this interval. The onset of modern El Ni{\~n}o activity around this time would have served to enhance the intrusion of 14C-depleted equatorial waters via the south equatorial branch of the SEC. Overall, the changes in reservoir age presented here for the western tropical Pacific suggest that Holocene changes in the El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation state of the tropical Pacific resulted in reorganisation of oceanic circulation in this region.},

	abstract = {This study unifies quantitative methods with dated molecular phylogenies of different lineages to identify biogeographical regions and understand the spatial and temporal evolution of the biota in one of the most biodiverse hotspots of the planet, the tropical Andes. We found complex distribution patterns reflected in a significantly higher number of bioregions than previous regionalization work has identified. In addition, this study found evidence that bioregions' drivers were processes of Andean uplift and mountain dispersal facilitated by temperature oscillations during the Pleistocene. Therefore, Andean bioregions were formed from a combination of vicariance and dispersal events, which occurred in different time periods. Our results will help set conservation priorities that preserve the evolutionary patterns of biodiversity. Understanding the spatial and temporal evolution of biota in the tropical Andes is a major challenge, given the region's topographic complexity and high beta diversity. We used a network approach to find biogeographic regions (bioregions) based on high-resolution species distribution models for 151 endemic bird taxa. Then, we used dated molecular phylogenies of 14 genera to reconstruct the area history through a sequence of allopatric speciation processes. We identified 15 biogeographical regions and found 26 events of isolation and diversification within their boundaries that are independently confirmed with disjunct distributions of sister taxa. Furthermore, these events are spatially congruent with six geographical barriers related to warm and/or dry river valleys, discontinuities in elevation, and high peaks separating fauna from different range slopes. The most important barrier is the Mara{\~n}on River Valley, which limits the boundaries of four bioregions and is congruent with eight phylogenetic distribution breaks, separating the Central and Northern Andes, where the most bioregions are found. We also show that many bioregions have diffuse and overlapping structures, with contact and transition zones that challenge previous conceptions of biogeographical regions as spatially simple in structure. This study found evidence that the drivers of our identified bioregions were processes of Andean uplift and mountain dispersal facilitated by temperature oscillations of the Pleistocene. Therefore, Andean bioregions were not formed from one simple biogeographical event in a certain time frame, but from a combination of vicariance and dispersal events, which occurred in different time periods.},

	n2 = {Abstract Phylogenetic studies of geographic range evolution are increasingly using statistical model selection methods to choose among variants of the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model, especially between DEC and DEC+J, a variant that emphasizes ?jump dispersal,? or founder-event speciation, as a type of cladogenetic range inheritance scenario. Unfortunately, DEC+J is a poor model of founder-event speciation, and statistical comparisons of its likelihood with DEC are inappropriate. DEC and DEC+J share a conceptual flaw: cladogenetic events of range inheritance at ancestral nodes, unlike anagenetic events of dispersal and local extinction along branches, are not modelled as being probabilistic with respect to time. Ignoring this probability factor artificially inflates the contribution of cladogenetic events to the likelihood, and leads to underestimates of anagenetic, time-dependent range evolution. The flaw is exacerbated in DEC+J because not only is jump dispersal allowed, expanding the set of cladogenetic events, its probability relative to non-jump events is assigned a free parameter, j, that when maximized precludes the possibility of non-jump events at ancestral nodes. DEC+J thus parameterizes the mode of speciation, but like DEC, it does not parameterize the rate of speciation. This inconsistency has undesirable consequences, such as a greater tendency towards degenerate inferences in which the data are explained entirely by cladogenetic events (at which point branch lengths become irrelevant, with estimated anagenetic rates of 0). Inferences with DEC+J can in some cases depart dramatically from intuition, e.g. when highly unparsimonious numbers of jump dispersal events are required solely because j is maximized. Statistical comparison with DEC is inappropriate because a higher DEC+J likelihood does not reflect a more close approximation of the ?true? model of range evolution, which surely must include time-dependent processes; instead, it is simply due to more weight being allocated (via j) to jump dispersal events whose time-dependent probabilities are ignored. In testing hypotheses about the geographic mode of speciation, jump dispersal can and should instead be modelled using existing frameworks for state-dependent lineage diversification in continuous time, taking appropriate cautions against Type I errors associated with such methods. For simple inference of ancestral ranges on a fixed phylogeny, a DEC-based model may be defensible if statistical model selection is not used to justify the choice, and it is understood that inferences about cladogenetic range inheritance lack any relation to time, normally a fundamental axis of evolutionary models.},

	abstract = {Founder-event speciation, where a rare jump dispersal event founds a new genetically isolated lineage, has long been considered crucial by many historical biogeographers, but its importance is disputed within the vicariance school. Probabilistic modeling of geographic range evolution creates the potential to test different biogeographical models against data using standard statistical model choice procedures, as long as multiple models are available. I re-implement the Dispersal--Extinction--Cladogenesis (DEC) model of LAGRANGE in the R package BioGeoBEARS, and modify it to create a new model, DEC + J, which adds founder-event speciation, the importance of which is governed by a new free parameter, j. The identifiability of DEC and DEC + J is tested on data sets simulated under a wide range of macroevolutionary models where geography evolves jointly with lineage birth/death events. The results confirm that DEC and DEC + J are identifiable even though these models ignore the fact that molecular phylogenies are missing many cladogenesis and extinction events. The simulations also indicate that DEC will have substantially increased errors in ancestral range estimation and parameter inference when the true model includes + J. DEC and DEC + J are compared on 13 empirical data sets drawn from studies of island clades. Likelihood-ratio tests indicate that all clades reject DEC, and AICc model weights show large to overwhelming support for DEC + J, for the first time verifying the importance of founder-event speciation in island clades via statistical model choice. Under DEC + J, ancestral nodes are usually estimated to have ranges occupying only one island, rather than the widespread ancestors often favored by DEC. These results indicate that the assumptions of historical biogeography models can have large impacts on inference and require testing and comparison with statistical methods.},

	abstract = {Aim

The species diversity and endemism of tropical biotas are major contributors to global biodiversity, but the factors underlying the formation of these systems remain poorly understood.

Location

The world's largest tropical island, New Guinea.

Time period

Miocene to present.

Major taxa studied

Passerine birds.

Methods

We first generated a species-level phylogeny of all native breeding passerine birds to analyse spatial and elevational patterns of species richness, species age and phylogenetic diversity. Second, we used an existing dataset on bill morphology to analyse spatial and elevational patterns of functional diversity.

Results

The youngest New Guinean species are principally distributed in the lowlands and outlying mountain ranges, with the lowlands also maintaining the majority of non-endemic species. In contrast, many species occurring in the central mountain range are phylogenetically distinct, range-restricted, endemic lineages. Centres of accumulation for the oldest species are in montane forest, with these taxa having evolved unique bill forms in comparison to the remaining New Guinean species. For the morphological generalists, attaining a highland distribution does not necessarily represent the end to dispersal and diversification, because a number of new species have formed in the outlying mountain ranges, following recent colonization from the central range.

Main conclusions

We conclude that a general model of tropical montane diversification is that lineages commonly colonize the lowlands, shifting their ranges upslope through time to become range-restricted montane forest endemics, attaining novel functional adaptations to these environments.},

	n2 = {The island of New Guinea lies in one of the most tectonically active regions in the world and has long provided outstanding opportunity for studies of biogeography. Several chelid turtles, of clear Gondwanal origin, occur in New Guinea; all species except one, the endemic Elseya novaeguineae, are restricted to the lowlands south of the Central Ranges. Elseya novaeguineae is found throughout New Guinea. We use mitochondrial and nuclear gene variation among populations of E. novaeguineae throughout its range to test hypotheses of recent extensive dispersal versus more ancient persistence in New Guinea. Its genetic structure bears the signature of Miocene vicariance events. The date of the divergence between a Birds Head (Kepala Burung) clade and clades north and south of the Central Ranges is estimated to be 19.8 Mya {$[$}95{\%} highest posterior density (HPD) interval of 13.3--26.8 Mya{$]$} and the date between the northern and southern clades is estimated to be slightly more recent at 17.4 Mya (95{\%} HPD interval of 11.0--24.5 Mya). The distribution of this endemic species is best explained by persistent occupation (or early invasion and dispersal) and subsequent isolation initiated by the dramatic landform changes that were part of the Miocene history of the island of New Guinea, rather than as a response to the contemporary landscape of an exceptionally effective disperser. The driving influence on genetic structure appears to have been isolation arising from a combination of: (1) the early uplift of the Central Ranges and establishment of a north‐south drainage divide; (2) development of the Langguru Fold Belt; (3) the opening of Cenderawasih Bay; and (4) the deep waters of the Aru Trough and Cenderawasih Bay that come close to the current coastline to maintain isolation of the Birds Head through periods of sea level minima (−135 m). The dates of divergence of turtle populations north and south of the ranges predate the telescopic uplift of the central ranges associated with oblique subduction of the Australian Plate beneath the Pacific Plate. Their isolation was probably associated with earlier uplift and drainage isolation driven by the accretion of island terranes to the northern boundary of the Australian craton that occurred earlier than the oblique subduction. The opening of Cenderawasih Bay is too recent (6 Mya) to have initiated the isolation of the Birds Head populations from those of the remainder of New Guinea, although its deep waters will have served to sustain the isolation through successive sea level changes. The molecular evidence suggests that the Birds Head docked with New Guinea some time before the Central Ranges emerged as a barrier to turtle dispersal. Overall, deep genetic structure of the species complex reflects events and processes that occurred during Miocene, whereas structure within each clade across the New Guinea landscape relates to Pliocene and Pleistocene times. {\copyright}2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 111, 192--208.},

	abstract = {{Aims. Mountain ranges in the tropics are characterised by high levels of
   localised endemism, often-aberrant evolutionary trajectories, and some
   of the worlds most diverse regional biotas. Here we investigate the
   evolution of montane endemism, ecology and body size in a clade of
   direct-developing frogs (Choerophryne, Microhylidae) from New Guinea.
   Methods. Phylogenetic relationships were estimated from a mitochondrial
   molecular dataset using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches.
   Ancestral state reconstruction was used to infer the evolution of
   elevational distribution, ecology (indexed by male calling height), and
   body size, and phylogenetically corrected regression was employed to
   examine the relationships between these three traits.
   Results. We obtained strong support for a monophyletic lineage
   comprising the majority of taxa sampled. Within this clade we identified
   one subclade that appears to have diversified primarily in montane
   habitats of the Central Cordillera (>1000 m. a.s.l), with subsequent
   dispersal to isolated North Papuan Mountains. A second subclade
   (characterised by moderately to very elongated snouts) appears to have
   diversified primarily in hill forests (<1000 m a.s.l.), with inferred
   independent upwards colonisations of isolated montane habitats,
   especially in isolated North Papuan Mountains. We found no clear
   relationship between extremely small body size (adult SVL less than 15
   mm) and elevation, but a stronger relationship with ecology smaller
   species tend to be more terrestrial.
   Conclusions. Orogeny and climatic oscillations have interacted to
   generate high montane biodiversity in New Guinea via both localised
   diversification within montane habitats (centric endemism) and periodic
   dispersal across lowland regions (eccentric endemism). The correlation
   between extreme miniaturisation and terrestrial habits reflects a
   general trend in frogs, suggesting that ecological or physiological
   constraints limit niche usage by miniaturised frogs, even in extremely
   wet environments such as tropical mountains.}},

	abstract = {{The butterfly tribe Candalidini is geographically restricted to
   Australia and mainland New Guinea and its adjacent islands. With 60
   species and subspecies, it represents a large radiation of Papilionoidea
   in the Australian region. Although the species-level taxonomy is
   relatively well understood, the number of genera is uncertain, varying
   from two to eight. We reconstructed the phylogeny of the Candalidini
   based on a 13-locus hybrid enrichment probe set (12.8 Kbp: COI,
   Thiolase, CAD, CAT, DDC, EF1-a, GAPDH, HCL, IDH, MDH, RPS2, RPS5,
   Wingless), including all previously recognized genera and 76\% (28/37)
   of the species-level diversity of the tribe. Maximum likelihood analysis
   recovered the Candalidini as a strongly supported monophyletic group. In
   conjunction with morphological characters, the phylogeny provided a
   robust framework for a revised classification in which we recognize four
   genera, 37 species and 23 subspecies. The genus Nesolycaena Waterhouse
   \& R.E. Turner is considered in synonymy with Candalides Hubner, and
   four other genera are not recognized, namely, Holochila C. Felder,
   Adaluma Tindale, Zetona Waterhouse and Microscena Tite. Of the four
   valid genera, the absimilis group (23 species) is placed in the newly
   described genus Eirmocides Braby, Espeland \& Muller gen. nov. (type
   species Candalides consimilis Waterhouse). The erinus group (six
   species) is assigned to Erina Swainson, which is reinstated.
   Chrysophanus cyprotus Olliff is assigned to Cyprotides Tite, which is
   also reinstated as a monotypic genus. The remaining seven species are
   placed in Candalides sensu stricto. Overall, we propose 47 new
   nomenclatural changes at the species and subspecies levels, including
   the synonymy of Holochila biaka Tite as Eirmocides tringa biaka (Tite)
   syn. nov. et comb. nov. and recognition of Candalides hyacinthinus
   gilesi M.R. Williams \& Bollam as a distinct species Erina gilesi (M.R.
   Williams \& Bollam stat. rev. et comb. nov. A dated phylogeny using
   Bayesian inference in BEAST2 and biogeographical and habitat analyses
   based on the DEC model in BioGeoBEARS indicated that the ancestor of the
   Candalidini most likely evolved in rainforest habitats of the mesic
   biome in situ on the Australian plate of Southern Gondwana during the
   Eocene (c. 43 Ma). A major period of diversification occurred in the
   Miocene, which coincided with aridification of the Australian continent,
   followed by a further episode of radiation in montane New Guinea during
   the Plio-Pleistocene.

   Here we show that the origin of extant leaf insects lies in the

   which most of the similar to 100 described species pertain is recovered
   as paraphyletic and its three non-nominate subgenera are recovered as

   rank. This first phylogeny covering all major phylliid groups provides
   the basis for future studies on their taxonomy and a framework to unveil
   more of their cryptic and underestimated diversity.Bank et al.

   the evolution of clades dwelling in the archipelagic parts of the
   Oriental and Australian regions remains equivocal. Using a complete,
   species-level phylogeny of Polyura butterflies that are widespread in
   the oriental Palaeotropics, we aim to test predictions related to
   vicariance driven by past abiotic factors in the Indo-Australian
   archipelago (IAA) (Miocene tectonics and Pleistocene climatic shifts)
   versus repeated trans-archipelagic dispersal events.
   LocationThe Oriental and Australian regions with a focus on the IAA.
   MethodsBayesian species tree phylogenetic analyses were conducted using
   a matrix comprising two mitochondrial and two nuclear gene fragments.
   Bayesian relaxed clocks were used to produce a chronogram, which was
   used in ancestral area estimations to infer the spatio-temporal
   evolution of the genus at different geographical scales. Diversification
   dynamics were investigated using the package TreePar in R.
   ResultsPolyura originated during the mid-Miocene (c.13million years
   ago). Ancestral area estimations inferred an origin in Indomalaya.
   Wallacea was colonized out-of-Indomalaya in the P. pyrrhus group, while
   the P. athamas and P. eudamippus groups diversified in Indomalaya and
   the east Palaearctic. We inferred three long-distance dispersal (LDD)
   events. The first one implies out-of-Sunda colonization of the Solomon
   Islands, which have three extant, endemic species. The second implies a
   colonization of Vanuatu out-of-Sunda that later served as a stepping
   stone for the colonization of other Pacific islands (Fiji and New
   Caledonia). A third permitted the reverse colonization of Wallacea from
   the Pacific islands. These LDD events were supported by our
   diversification analyses that suggested no diversification rate shift
   throughout the evolution of the genus.
   Main conclusionsOur results suggest unusual colonization routes with
   Pacific islands as a hub for late Miocene reverse colonizations back
   into the centre of the Indo-Australian archipelago.}},

Currently recognized global biodiversity hotspots are spatially too coarse for conservation management and identification of hotspots at a finer scale is needed. This might be achieved by identification of areas of endemism. Here, we identify areas of endemism in Iran, a major component of the Irano-Anatolian biodiversity hotspot, and address their ecological correlates. Using the extremely diverse sunflower family (Asteraceae) as our model system, five consensus areas of endemism were identified using the approach of endemicity analysis. Both endemic richness and degree of endemicity were positively related to topographic complexity and elevational range. The proportion of endemic taxa at a certain elevation (percent endemism) was not congruent with the proportion of total surface area at this elevation, but was higher in mountain ranges. While the distribution of endemic richness (i.e., number of endemic taxa) along an elevational gradient was hump-shaped peaking at mid-elevations, the percentage of endemism gradually increased with elevation. Patterns of endemic richness as well as areas of endemism identify mountain ranges as main centres of endemism, which is likely due to high environmental heterogeneity and strong geographic isolation among and within mountain ranges. The herein identified areas can form the basis for defining areas with conservation priority in this global biodiversity hotspot.},

	abstract = {We derive a new phylogenetic framework of the Indo‐Pacific avian genus Edolisoma based on a dense taxon sampling and use it in an explicit spatiotemporal framework to understand the history of intraspecific diversification dynamics in a `great speciator', the Cicadabird Edolisoma tenuirostre/remotum complex.
Location
The Indo‐Pacific island region, Australia and New Guinea.
Taxon
Corvoid passerine birds (Passeriformes).
Methods
We used Bayesian phylogenetic methods (beast) to construct a time‐calibrated molecular phylogeny of all 19 species in the genus Edolisoma and 27 of 29 subspecies of the E. tenuirostre/remotum complex (previously Coracina tenuirostris) primarily based on one mitochondrial DNA marker. Ancestral area reconstruction methods (`BioGeoBEARS') were used to infer the historical biogeography of the genus. We used population‐level analyses to assess intraspecific phylogeography and a molecular species delimitation test to evaluate the current taxonomy. A morphometric dataset was used to discuss differential dispersal ability among taxa.
Results
Edolisoma originated in the late Miocene and diversification within the E. tenuirostre/remotum complex began in the Pleistocene. Within the North Melanesian and North Wallacean archipelagos, which have experienced several waves of diversification, we find significant patterns of genetic isolation by distance, but not within the Australo‐Papuan `mainland', which was recently back‐colonized from these archipelagos. Based on the phylogeny, we suggest several taxonomic changes. We also discuss evidence of taxon cycles within Edolisoma based on correlations of species age, elevational ranges and dispersal ability.
Main conclusions
The biogeographical history and patterns of differentiation between phylogroups within E. tenuirostre support the importance of barriers to gene flow in island systems. Examples of both recent genetic exchange across significant sea barriers and differentiation across much smaller water gaps suggest complex dispersal and diversification dynamics. The capacity for dispersal away from islands, and gradual shifts in dispersal ability in relation to the geographical setting, is supported as important factors in generating a `great speciator'.},

@article{Wallace:2014,
	abstract = {Abstract We show results from a network of campaign Global Positioning System (GPS) sites in the Woodlark Rift, southeastern Papua New Guinea, in a transition from seafloor spreading to continental rifting. GPS velocities indicate anticlockwise rotation (at 2--2.7$\,^{\circ}$/Myr, relative to Australia) of crustal blocks north of the rift, producing 10--15 mm/yr of extension in the continental rift, increasing to 20--40 mm/yr of seafloor spreading at the Woodlark Spreading Center. Extension in the continental rift is distributed among multiple structures. These data demonstrate that low-angle normal faults in the continents, such as the Mai'iu Fault, can slip at high rates nearing 10 mm/yr. Extensional deformation observed in the D'Entrecasteaux Islands, the site of the world's only actively exhuming Ultra-High Pressure (UHP) rock terrane, supports the idea that extensional processes play a critical role in UHP rock exhumation. GPS data do not require significant interseismic coupling on faults in the region, suggesting that much of the deformation may be aseismic. Westward transfer of deformation from the Woodlark Spreading Center to the main plate boundary fault in the continental rift (the Mai'iu fault) is accommodated by clockwise rotation of a tectonic block beneath Goodenough Bay, and by dextral strike slip on transfer faults within (and surrounding) Normanby Island. Contemporary extension rates in the Woodlark Spreading Center are 30--50\% slower than those from seafloor spreading-derived magnetic anomalies. The 0.5 Ma to present seafloor spreading estimates for the Woodlark Basin may be overestimated, and a reevaluation of these data in the context of the GPS rates is warranted.},

Vietnamophryne Gen. nov. are secretive miniaturized frogs (SVL<21 mm) with a mostly semi-fossorial lifestyle. To assess phylogenetic relationships, we studied 12S rRNA-16S rRNA mtDNA fragments with a final alignment of 2?591 bp for 53 microhylid species. External morphology characters and osteological characteristics analyzed using micro-CT scanning were used for describing the new genus. Results of phylogenetic analyses assigned the new genus into the mainly Australasian subfamily Asterophryinae as a sister taxon to the genus Siamophryne from southern Indochina. The three specimens collected from Gia Lai Province in central Vietnam, Cao Bang Province in northern Vietnam, and Chiang Rai Province in northern Thailand proved to be separate species, different both in morphology and genetics (genetic divergence 3.1%≤P≤5.1%). Our work provides further evidence for the "out of Indo-Eurasia" scenario for Asterophryinae, indicating that the initial cladogenesis and differentiation of this group of frogs occurred in the Indochina Peninsula. To date, each of the three new species of Vietnamophryne Gen. nov. is known only from a single specimen; thus, their distribution, life history, and conservation status require further study.},

	abstract = {{One hundred and fifty years after Alfred Wallace studied the
   geographical variation and species diversity of butterflies in the
   Indomalayan-Australasian Archipelago, the processes responsible for
   their biogeographical pattern remain equivocal. We analysed the
   macroevolutionary mechanisms accounting for the temporal and
   geographical diversification of the charismatic birdwing butterflies
   (Papilionidae), a major focus of Wallace's pioneering work. Bayesian
   phylogenetics and dating analyses of the birdwings were conducted using
   mitochondrial and nuclear genes. The combination of maximum likelihood
   analyses to estimate biogeographical history and diversification rates
   reveals that diversity-dependence processes drove the radiation of
   birdwings, and that speciation was often associated with founder-events
   colonizing new islands, especially in Wallacea. Palaeo-environment
   diversification models also suggest that high extinction rates occurred
   during periods of elevated sea level and global warming. We demonstrated
   a pattern of spatio-temporal habitat dynamics that continuously created
   or erased habitats suitable for birdwing biodiversity. Since birdwings
   were extinction-prone during the Miocene (warmer temperatures and
   elevated sea levels), the cooling period after the mid-Miocene climatic
   optimum fostered birdwing diversification due to the release of
   extinction. This also suggests that current global changes may represent
   a serious conservation threat to this flagship group.}},

@article{Toussaint:2015a,
	abstract = {{During the Cenozoic, Australia experienced major climatic shifts that
   have had dramatic ecological consequences for the modern biota. Mesic
   tropical ecosystems were progressively restricted to the coasts and
   replaced by arid-adapted floral and faunal communities. Whilst the role
   of aridification has been investigated in a wide range of terrestrial
   lineages, the response of freshwater clades remains poorly investigated.
   To gain insights into the diversification processes underlying a
   freshwater radiation, we studied the evolutionary history of the
   Australasian predaceous diving beetles of the tribe Hydroporini (147
   described species). We used an integrative approach including the latest
   methods in phylogenetics, divergence time estimation, ancestral
   character state reconstruction, and likelihood-based methods of
   diversification rate estimation. Phylogenies and dating analyses were
   reconstructed with molecular data from seven genes (mitochondrial and
   nuclear) for 117 species (plus 12 outgroups). Robust and well-resolved
   phylogenies indicate a late Oligocene origin of Australasian
   Hydroporini. Biogeographic analyses suggest an origin in the East Coast
   region of Australia, and a dynamic biogeographic scenario implying
   dispersal events. The group successfully colonized the tropical coastal
   regions carved by a rampant desertification, and also colonized
   groundwater ecosystems in Central Australia. Diversification rate
   analyses suggest that the ongoing aridification of Australia initiated
   in the Miocene contributed to a major wave of extinctions since the late
   Pliocene probably attributable to an increasing aridity, range
   contractions and seasonally disruptions resulting from Quaternary
   climatic changes. When comparing subterranean and epigean genera, our
   results show that contrasting mechanisms drove their diversification and
   therefore current diversity pattern. The Australasian Hydroporini
   radiation reflects a combination of processes that promoted both
   diversification, resulting from new ecological opportunities driven by
   initial aridification, and a subsequent loss of mesic adapted diversity
   due to increasing aridity.}},

@article{Abers:2002,
	abstract = {In many highly extended rifts on the Earth, tectonic removal of the upper crust exhumes mid-crustal rocks, producing metamorphic core complexes. These structures allow the upper continental crust to accommodate tens of kilometres of extension, but it is not clear how the lower crust and underlying mantle respond. Also, despite removal of the upper crust, such core complexes remain both topographically high and in isostatic equilibrium. Because many core complexes in the western United States are underlain by a flat Moho discontinuity, it has been widely assumed that their elevation is supported by flow in the lower crust or by magmatic underplating. These processes should decouple upper-crust extension from that in the mantle. In contrast, here we present seismic observations of metamorphic core complexes of the western Woodlark rift that show the overall crust to be thinned beneath regions of greatest surface extension. These core complexes are actively being exhumed at a rate of 5-10 km Myr-1, and the thinning of the underlying crust appears to be compensated by mantle rocks of anomalously low density, as indicated by low seismic velocities. We conclude that, at least in this case, the development of metamorphic core complexes and the accommodation of high extension is not purely a crustal phenomenon, but must involve mantle extension.},

Yet, few molecular phylogenetic analyses of the terrestrial fauna have been carried out to understand the evolutionary patterns. We use dense taxon and character sampling of more than 7000 bp DNA sequence data for a group of diving beetles ranging from the Holarctic throughout Asia to as far east as French Polynesia. We here show that an ecologically diverse, common and widespread (Portugal to New Zealand) arthropod supertramp species originated in the highlands of New Guinea, ca 6.0-2.7 Myr ago. The approximately 25 closely related species are narrow endemics in Australasia/Oceania. The ancestor of this clade colonized that region from Eurasia ca 9-7 Myr ago. Our finding contradicts the widely held view of local endemism as an evolutionary dead end, as we find multiple peripatric speciation events within the Pleistocene and complex colonization patterns between the Oriental and Australian zoogeographic regions, including the recolonization of Eurasia, jumping across Wallace's line and colonization of continental Australia out of New Guinea. Our study strongly highlights the importance of dispersal over water gaps in shaping biogeographic patterns.},

The present contribution is the sixth in a series of reports dealing with this endemic fauna, and presents a cladistic analysis at the generic level for the subfamily, a biogeographic analysis, a world checklist, a complete bibliography, and final taxonomic addenda. The taxonomic appendix contains new distributional records for Stygiobates mubi Polhemus & Polhemus, and descriptions of the following new taxa: the new genus Talaudia to hold the previously described Andersenella nilsi Chen & Nieser from the Talaud Archipelago; Metrobatoides bifurcatus sp. n. from northern central Irian Jaya; and Iobates ivimka sp. n. from southern Papua New Guinea. The current cladistic analysis supports the previously proposed tribal classification, with the Metrobatini, Trepobatini, Naboandelini, and Stenobatini all resolved as discrete monophyletic groups. Our cladistic and biogeographic analyses also suggest that the current distribution of trepobatine genera in the New Guinea region has been strongly influenced by past tectonic events, most notably the accretion of island arc terranes derived from the Solomons and Halmahera arc systems. This has led to distinct areas of freshwater and marine endemism among the Metrobatini and Stenobatini in the areas surrounding Halmahera, the Vogelkop Peninsula, and northeastern New Guinea plus nearby islands. By contrast, the distribution of Naboandelini in the New Guinea region suggests a vicariance pattern with Australia across the Torres Strait.},

	abstract = {Regions with complex geological histories often have diverse and highly endemic biotas, yet inferring the ecological and historical processes shaping this relationship remains challenging. Here, in the context of the taxon cycle model of insular community assembly, we investigate patterns of lineage diversity and habitat usage in a newly characterized vertebrate radiation centred upon the world's most geologically complex insular region: island arcs spanning from the Philippines to Fiji. On island arcs taxa are ecologically widespread, and provide evidence to support one key prediction of the taxon cycle, specifically that interior habitats (lowland rainforests, montane habitats) are home to a greater number of older or relictual lineages than are peripheral habitats (coastal and open forests). On continental fringes, however, the clade shows a disjunct distribution away from lowland rainforest, occurring in coastal, open or montane habitats. These results are consistent with a role for biotic interactions in shaping disjunct distributions (a central tenant of the taxon cycle), but we find this pattern most strongly on continental fringes not islands. Our results also suggest that peripheral habitats on islands, and especially island arcs, may be important for persistence and diversification, not just dispersal and colonization. Finally, new phylogenetic evidence for subaerial island archipelagos (with an associated biota) east of present-day Wallace's Line since the Oligocene has important implications for understanding long-term biotic interchange and assembly across Asia and Australia.},

	abstract = {{Major hydrocarbon discoveries have been made in eastern and westernmost
   New Guinea, and there is great potential for additional discoveries.
   Although the island is a type locality for arc-continent collision
   during the Cenozoic, the age, number, and plate kine matics of the
   events that formed the island are vigorously argued. The northern part
   of the island is underlain by rocks with oceanic island arc affinities,
   and the southern part is underlain by the Australian continental crust.
   Based on regional sedimentation patterns, it is argued herein that the
   Cenozoic tectonic history of the island involves two distinct
   collisional orogenic events.
   The first Cenozoic event, the Peninsular orogeny of Oligocene age
   (similar to35-30 Ma), was restricted to easternmost New Guinea. Emergent
   uplifts that shed abundant detritus resulted from the subduction of the
   northeastern corner of the Australian continent beneath part of the
   Inner Melanesian arc. This collision uplifted the Papuan ophiolite and
   formed the associated mountainous uplift that was the primary source of
   siliciclastic sediments that largely filled the Aure trough. Between the
   Oligocene and Miocene, the paleogeography of the region was similar to
   present-day New Caledonia. The continental crust under central and
   western New Guinea remained a passive margin.
   The second event, the Central Range orogeny, began in the latest middle
   Miocene, when the bulldozing of Australian passive-margin strata first
   created emergent uplifts above a north-dipping subduction zone beneath
   the western part of the Outer Melanesian arc. The cessation of carbonate
   shelf sedimentation and widespread initiation of siliciclastic
   sedimentation on top of the Australian continental basement is dated at
   about 12 Ma. This collision emplaced the Irian ophiolite and created the
   present mountainous topography forming the spine of the island.}},

@article{Wilson:1959,
	abstract = {1. The zoogeography of the Melanesian ponerine fauna is preliminarily analyzed. Most of the fauna has apparently been derived ultimately from Oriental stocks entering by way of New Guinea; some invading species are able to spread beyond this island to Queensland and outer Melanesia. A smaller part of the fauna has been derived from old Australian stocks that have entered by way of New Guinea or New Caledonia. Faunal flow from New Guinea through outer Melanesia has been unidirectional, with an ever diminishing number of species groups found outward from the Bismarcks to the Fiji Islands. New Caledonia draws almost all of its fauna from eastern Australia and has engaged in very little direct faunal exchange with the remainder of Melanesia. 2. A cyclical pattern of expansion, diversification, and contraction is hypothesized to account for later evolutionary events following initial dispersal. Following invasion of Melanesia (Stage I, primary), the pioneer populations may then diverge to species level (Stage II) and further diversify. Eventually the source populations outside Melanesia tend to contract, leaving the species group as a whole peripheral and Melanesian-centered (Stage III). Endemic Melanesian species occasionally enter upon a secondary phase of expansion (Stage I, secondary) but are rarely if ever able to push beyond Australia or the Philippines. 3. Stage-I species are characterized on New Guinea by their greater concentration in "marginal" habitats, including open lowland forest, savanna, and littoral. The central habitats, including denser lowland forest and montane forest, contain significantly larger faunas as well as a higher percentage of Stage-II and Stage-III species. Stage-I species are also characterized by their individual occurrence in a greater range of major habitats. Finally, these species make up a significantly higher proportion of the faunas of the archipelagos of central Melanesia, including the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomon Islands, and the New Hebrides. 4. On the basis of these data it is suggested that ponerine species normally invade New Guinea by way of the marginal habitats. Evolutionary opportunity is nevertheless limited in the marginal habitats, and there is a strong selective pressure favoring re-entry into the inner rain forest habitats. In general, Stages II and III, leading to the origin of the great bulk of the Melanesian fauna and its most distinctive endemic elements, are played out only in the inner rain forest.},

	abstract = {Data concerning the distribution of land vertebrates and marine molluscs from the Triassic to the present are utilised in an investigation of former continental relationships. Factors controlling the distribution of living representatives of these groups are discussed and it is indicated how regions of deep ocean restrict the distribution of the predominantly neritic molluscan faunas almost as effectively as they do land animals. Complementarity in distribution patterns in the continental and marine faunas resulting from the emergence of land bridges proves an especially useful tool in interpreting fossil distributions.
The information derived from living (together with recently extinct) faunas is applied to the study of older faunas. The distribution of many Mesozoic faunas appears to demand the existence of land and/or shelf sea connections between continents where none exists today. The old concept of trans-oceanic land bridges being considered unsatisfactory, an interpretation based on Late Mesozoic and Early Tertiary continental drift is preferred, taking into account other geological and geophysical data. None of the palaeozoogeographic data surveyed is obviously incompatible with drift, and much is difficult to explain without it.
Palaeozoogeographic data are thought to be especially useful in establishing a timetable for continental drift. In the hypothesis proposed it is argued that Gondwanaland did not begin to disintegrate substantially until well into the Cretaceous. The opening of the North Atlantic could possibly have taken place earlier but data are as yet inadequate to decide. The best evidence so far comes from the North Pacific region and suggests that a Bering land bridge was established by Middle or Late Cretaceous time. During the Early Tertiary the Australasian continent is considered to have moved northwards towards Indonesia and the African-Arabian continent rotated slightly anticlockwise, impinging upon Asia Minor and hence dividing the Tethyan seaway into two. The onset of a significant amount of drifting in the Middle and Late Cretaceous might be bound up with the growth of a major oceanic ridge system, which also had the effect of causing sea level to rise substantially.},

	abstract = {A series of tables lists land mammals common to North America and Eurasia, their probable times of migration by subepochs throughout the Cenozoic, and important groups that did not migrate in given subepochs. Major faunal interchanges occurred in early Eocene, late Eocene, early Oligocene, late Miocene, middle to late Pliocene, and Pleistocene. There was little or no interchange in the middle Eocene and middle to late Oligocene. Each interchange involved migration in both directions, but there was probably more movement from Eurasia to North America than in the opposite direction. All interchanges were selective, and they became increasingly limited from Eocene to Pleistocene. The most important selective influence was probably the relatively cold climate of the land connection. This connection was probably from Siberia to Alaska throughout the Cenozoic and was in almost continuous existence with important interruptions in parts of the Eocene and Oligocene and perhaps shorter interruptions at later times. The measurement of faunal resemblance in general is discussed, and mammalian faunal resemblance between Eurasia and North America charted for the Cenozoic. Changes in resemblance are correlated with five factors: faunal interchange, extinction of autochthones, divergent evolution, local extinction of migrants, and migration from other regions.},

@article{Wilson:1961,
	abstract = {Undisturbed ant faunas of islands in the Moluccas-Melanesian arc are for the most part "saturated," that is, approach a size that is correlated closely with the landmass of the island but only weakly with its geographic location (figure 1). In the Ponerinae and Cerapachyinae combined the saturation level can be expressed approximately as F=3A0.6, where F is the number of species in the fauna and A the area of the island in square miles. Interspecific competition, involving some degree of colonial warfare, plays a major role in the determination of the saturation curve. It deploys the distribution of some ant species into mosaic patterns and increases the diversification of local faunas. Perhaps because of the complex nature of the Melanesian fauna, differences between local faunas appear that give the subjective impression of randomness. Despite the action of species exclusion, the size of local faunas occurring within a set sample area increases with the total size of the island (figure 2). Water gaps break populations and initiate speciation in Melanesia. Endemic insular faunas build up primarily by the process of multiple invasion. Expanding species now on Melanesia originated almost exclusively from tropical Asia, New Guinea, and Australia. Faunal dominance, measured by the degree of faunal interpenetration, is a direct function of land area and is less directly related to insular faunal size (figure 4). Taxa originating in Melanesia exclusive of New Guinea are almost all confined to the archipelagoes of their birth. The following taxon cycle is postulated. A taxon maintains its headquarters in a given land mass indefinitely, expanding and contracting cyclically, or else it declines to extinction. The headquarters can be shifted from a larger to a smaller land mass (for example, from New Guinea to Fiji) but not in the reverse direction (figure 9). Taxa originating in Melanesia exclusive of New Guinea are almost all confined to the archipelagoes of their birth. On New Guinea, expanding species occur primarily in marginal habitats. In the inner rain forest habitats they are replaced by the large endemic faunas. On archipelagoes with small endemic faunas, the expanding species are ecologically "released," becoming abundant in the inner forest habitats and otherwise increasing their ecological amplitude. As a group they are characterized by great diversification among themselves. No genus among those studied has produced more than three Asia-based or four New Guineabased Stage-I species (figure 8). No genus studied, including the largest and most successful, has a total of more than seven Stage-I species on New Guinea. Sympatric Stage-I species in the same genus tend to be ecologically and morphologically very dissimilar. The following rule is predicted: the ecological amplitude of individual species, both expanding and endemic, should be negatively correlated with the size of the local fauna to which they belong and hence the size of the island on which they occur. The prediction is based on the phenomenon of ecological release of Stage-I species and appears to be supported by some fragmentary evidence relating to Fijian endemic species. Expanding species evidently play a major role in the fragmentation and speciation of older taxa. By dominating the faunas of smaller islands they maintain hiatuses in the ranges of the disjunct taxa. By saturating the marginal habitats they restrict the older taxa to the inner rain forest. Autochthonous and retreating taxa show certain common biological characteristics coadaptive with restriction to the inner forest habitats. These involve nest site preference, colony size, and foraging behavior (table 5). Three general attributes of success are recognized in the expanding Melanesian ant taxa: the acquisition of a significant ecological difference, which presumably reduces interspecific competition, the ability to penetrate the marginal habitats, and the ability to disperse across water gaps. it is suggested that the attributes are causally related in the sequence given. Success in the marginal habitats gives expanding species the advantage needed to encompass and progressively replace older resident taxa.},

	abstract = {{Background: The birds-of-paradise (Paradisaeidae) form one of the most
   prominent avian examples of sexual selection and show a complex
   biogeographical distribution. The family has accordingly been used as a
   case-study in several significant evolutionary and biogeographical
   syntheses. As a robust phylogeny of the birds-of-paradise has been
   lacking, these hypotheses have been tentative and difficult to assess.
   Here we present a well supported species phylogeny with divergence time
   estimates of the birds-of-paradise. We use this to assess if the rates
   of the evolution of sexually selected traits and speciation have been
   excessively high within the birds-of-paradise, as well as to
   re-interpret biogeographical patterns in the group.
   Results: The phylogenetic results confirm some traditionally recognized
   relationships but also suggest novel ones. Furthermore, we find that
   species pairs are geographically more closely linked than previously
   assumed. The divergence time estimates suggest that speciation within
   the birds-of-paradise mainly took place during the Miocene and the
   Pliocene, and that several polygynous and morphologically homogeneous
   genera are several million years old. Diversification rates further
   suggest that the speciation rate within birds-of-paradise is comparable
   to that of the enitre core Corvoidea.
   Conclusion: The estimated ages of morphologically homogeneous and
   polygynous genera within the birds-of-paradise suggest that there is no
   need to postulate a particularly rapid evolution of sexually selected
   morphological traits. The calculated divergence rates further suggest
   that the speciation rate in birds-of-paradise has not been excessively
   high. Thus the idea that sexual selection could generate high speciation
   rates and rapid changes in sexual ornamentations is not supported by our
   birds-of-paradise data. Potentially, hybridization and long generation
   times in polygynous male birds-of-paradise have constrained
   morphological diversification and speciation, but external ecological
   factors on New Guinea may also have allowed the birds-of-paradise to
   develop and maintain magnificent male plumages. We further propose that
   the restricted but geographically complex distributions of
   birds-of-paradise species may be a consequence of the promiscuous
   breeding system.}},

	abstract = {Field, microstructural, and 40Ar/39Ar thermochronologic data from the Louisiade Archipelago, the southern rifted margin of the Woodlark Basin in SE Papua New Guinea, document an accretionary wedge that formed during Early‐Middle Miocene N‐dipping subduction of the Australian margin and transpression along the Australian‐Pacific plate boundary. Metasedimentary rocks of the Calvados Schist and the metagabbros that intrude them were metamorphosed at up to greenschist‐facies conditions. Three tectonic foliations (S1--S3) are present and F1--F3 fold hinges plunge ESE or WNW, parallel to mineral, stretching, and intersection lineations. Fold vergence is dominantly to the SW, and top‐to‐the‐SW thrusting of ultramafic rocks over the Calvados Schist is documented locally on Rossel Island. The data suggest progressive deformation associated with NNE‐SSW shortening and ESE‐WNW extension via dissolution‐precipitation creep and, more locally, dislocation creep. 40Ar/39Ar step‐heating analyses of three white mica separates yield Middle Miocene plateau or plateau‐like segments that are affected by variable Pliocene argon loss and are interpreted as syntectonic mica growth during metamorphism and deformation followed by partial resetting just prior to the onset of seafloor spreading in the Woodlark Basin. A ∼12 Ma 40Ar/39Ar age from a dacite sill of the Panarora Volcanics provides a minimum age constraint for the termination of northward subduction and a maximum age for crosscutting brittle strike‐slip faults. These data are critical to constraining the subduction‐exhumation history of the world's youngest high‐ultrahigh‐pressure terrane and further support analogies between SE Papua New Guinea and the Early Oligocene Western Alps.

	abstract = {The microhylid frogs of the New Guinea region are the largest and most ecologically diverse subfamily (Asterophryinae) of one of the largest anuran families in the world and can live in communities of up to 20 species. While there has been recent progress in resolving the phylogenetic relationships of Asterophryinae, significant uncertainties remain, impeding further progress in understanding the evolution of microhabitat use, parental care, and life history variation in this group. In particular, the early divergences at the base of the tree remain unclear; as does the monophyly of some genera; and recent studies have discovered that species with wide geographic distribution are instead cryptic species complexes. In this study, we fortified geographic sampling of the largest previous phylogenetic effort by sequencing an additional 62 taxa and increased data quality and quantity by adding new layers of data vetting and by filling in previously incomplete loci to the five gene dataset (2 mitochondrial, 3 nuclear protein-coding genes) to obtain a dataset that is now 99% complete in over 2400 characters for 233 samples (205 taxa) of Asterophryinae and 3 outgroup taxa, and analyzed microhabitat use data for these taxa from field data and data collected from the literature. Importantly, our sampling includes complete community complements at 19 sites as well as representatives at over 80 sites across New Guinea and its offshore islands. We present a highly resolved molecular phylogeny which, for the first time, has over 95% of nodes supported (84% highly supported) whether using Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian Inference, allowing clarification of all genera (whether monophyletic or clearly not), their sister genera relationships, as well as an age estimate for the Asterophryinae at approximately 20MYA. Early generic diversification occurring between 17 and 12 MYA gave rise to a surprising diversity of about 18 genera as well as the 5 putative microhabitat types. Our tree reveals extensive cryptic diversity calling any widespread taxa into doubt, and clearly demonstrates that complex multispecies communities of Asterophryinae are ecologically diverse, are numerous, and of ancient origin across New Guinea. We discuss the implications of our phylogeny for explaining the explosive diversification of Asterophryinae as the result of adaptive radiation, niche conservatism, and non-adaptive radiation.},

	abstract = {The small size and apparent external morphological similarity of the minute salamanders of the genus Thorius have long hindered evolutionary studies of the group. We estimate gene and species trees within the genus using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA from nearly all named and many candidate species and find three main clades. We use this phylogenetic hypothesis to examine patterns of morphological evolution and species coexistence across central and southern Mexico and to test alternative hypotheses of lineage divergence with and without ecomorphological divergence. Sympatric species differ in body size more than expected after accounting for phylogenetic relationship, and morphological traits show no significant phylogenetic signal. Sympatric species tend to differ in a combination of body size, presence or absence of maxillary teeth, and relative limb or tail length, even when they are close relatives. Sister species of Thorius tend to occupy climatically similar environments, which suggests that divergence across climatic gradients does not drive species formation in the genus. Rather than being an example of cryptic species formation, Thorius more closely resembles an adaptive radiation, with ecomorphological divergence that is bounded by organism-level constraints. {\copyright} 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 622--643.},

@article{Kozak:2005,
	abstract = {An important dimension of adaptive radiation is the degree to which diversification rates fluctuate or remain constant through time. Focusing on plethodontid salamanders of the genus Desmognathus, we present a novel synthetic analysis of phylogeographic history, rates of ecomorphological evolution and species accumulation, and community assembly in an adaptive radiation. Dusky salamanders are highly variable in life history, body size, and ecology, with many endemic lineages in the southern Appalachian Highlands of eastern North America. Our results show that life-history evolution had important consequences for the buildup of plethodontid-salamander species richness and phenotypic disparity in eastern North America, a global hot spot of salamander biodiversity. The origin of Desmognathus species with aquatic larvae was followed by a high rate of lineage accumulation, which then gradually decreased toward the present time. The peak period of lineage accumulation in the group coincides with evolutionary partitioning of lineages with aquatic larvae into seepage, stream-edge, and stream microhabitats. Phylogenetic simulations demonstrate a strong correlation between morphology and microhabitat ecology independent of phylogenetic effects and suggest that ecomorphological changes are concentrated early in the radiation of Desmognathus. Deep phylogeographic fragmentation within many codistributed ecomorph clades suggests long-term persistence of ecomorphological features and stability of endemic lineages and communities through multiple climatic cycles. Phylogenetic analyses of community structure show that ecomorphological divergence promotes the coexistence of lineages and that repeated, independent evolution of microhabitat-associated ecomorphs has a limited role in the evolutionary assembly of Desmognathus communities. Comparing and contrasting our results to other adaptive radiations having different biogeographic histories, our results suggest that rates of diversification during adaptive radiation are intimately linked to the degree to which community structure persists over evolutionary time.},

It has the most extensive geographical range of any salamander genus. While most species occur in Middle America, it ranges throughout most of tropical South America as well. Phylogenetic analysis of 1196 bp of two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b, 16S RNA) from 55 species offers strong support for the monophyly of the genus and sorts the species into a number of clades. Taking into account morphology, distribution, general ecology, and prior systematic and taxonomic studies, we recognize seven subgenera, four of them new: Bolitoglossa Dum{\'e}ril, Bibron et Dum{\'e}ril, 1854, Eladinea Miranda Ribeiro, 1937, Magnadigita Taylor, 1944, Mayamandra, Nanotriton, Oaxakia and Pachymandra. All South American and some lower Middle American species are included in a single well -supported clade, Eladinea. At the species level our analyses uncover the existence of large genetic diversity within morphologically homogeneous taxa. We propose the new combination: B. (Eladinea) paraensis (Unterstein, 1930) stat. nov., for Brazilian salamanders previously included under B. altamazonica. We evaluate evidence for the multiple colonization of the tropical lowlands by morphologically derived species groups. South America was invaded by members of one clade, Eladinea, which we infer to have dispersed to South America prior to closure of the Panamanian Portal. Despite the relatively long history of salamanders in South America, that continent now accounts for a relatively small proportion of the lineages and species of neotropical salamanders.}},

	abstract = {Delineating species boundaries correctly is crucial to the discovery of life's diversity because it determines whether or not different individual organisms are members of the same entity. The gap in communication between the different disciplines currently involved in delimiting species is an important and overlooked problem in the so-called `taxonomy crisis'. To solve this problem, it is suggested that taxonomy become integrative, and this integration is seen as the real challenge for the future of taxonomy. `Integrative taxonomy' is defined as the science that aims to delimit the units of life's diversity from multiple and complementary perspectives (phylogeography, comparative morphology, population genetics, ecology, development, behaviour, etc.). Some workers have already collaborated and successfully adopted an integrative approach to taxonomy. However, it is now time for the whole discipline to evolve. A radical change in mentality is needed concerning the creation of names in order to achieve this integration and to prevent the over-abundance of both synonyms and names of doubtful application from worsening. Integrative taxonomy gives priority to species delineation over the creation of new species names. Furthermore, it is emphasized that describing morphological diversity, referred to as `morphodiversity', does not require the naming of any single set of specimens. Seven guidelines are proposed to help integrative taxonomists recognize cases when species are supported by broad biological evidence and therefore are deserving of an official name. {\copyright} 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 85, 407--415.},

We performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Coleoptera inferred from three genes and nearly 1900 species, representing more than 80% of the world's recognized beetle families. We defined basal relationships in the Polyphaga supergroup, which contains over 300,000 species, and established five families as the earliest branching lineages. By dating the phylogeny, we found that the success of beetles is explained neither by exceptional net diversification rates nor by a predominant role of herbivory and the Cretaceous rise of angiosperms. Instead, the pre-Cretaceous origin of more than 100 present-day lineages suggests that beetle species richness is due to high survival of lineages and sustained diversification in a variety of niches.},

	abstract = {
We report on a discovery of \textit{Siamophryne troglodytes} \textbf{Gen. et sp. nov.,} a new troglophilous genus and species of microhylid frog from a limestone cave in the tropical forests of western Thailand. To assess its phylogenetic relationships we studied the 12S rRNA--16S rRNA mtDNA fragment with final alignment comprising up to 2,591 bp for 56 microhylid species. Morphological characterization of the new genus is based on examination of external morphology and analysis of osteological characteristics using microCT-scanning. Phylogenetic analyses place the new genus into the mainly Australasian subfamily Asterophryinae as a sister taxon to the genus \textit{Gastrophrynoides}, the only member of the subfamily known from Sundaland. The new genus markedly differs from all other Asterophryinae members by a number of diagnostic morphological characters and demonstrates significant mtDNA sequence divergence. We provide a preliminary description of a tadpole of the new genus. Thus, it represents the only asterophryine taxon with documented free-living larval stage and troglophilous life style. Our work demonstrates that \textit{S. troglodytes} \textbf{Gen. et sp. nov.} represents an old lineage of the initial radiation of Asterophryinae which took place in the mainland Southeast Asia. Our results strongly support the ``out of Indo-Eurasia'' biogeographic scenario for this group of frogs. To date, the new frog is only known from a single limestone cave system in Sai Yok District of Kanchanaburi Province of Thailand; its habitat is affected by illegal bat guano mining and other human activities. As such, \textit{S. troglodytes} \textbf{Gen. et sp. nov.} is likely to be at high risk of habitat loss. Considering high ecological specialization and a small known range of the new taxon, we propose a IUCN Red List status of endangered for it.

We characterize a diverse clade of frogs (Kaloula, Microhylidae) in the Philippine island archipelago as an example of an adaptive radiation into three primary habitat specialists or ecotypes. We use a novel phylogenetic estimate for this clade to evaluate the tempo of lineage accumulation and morphological diversification. Because species-level phylogenetic estimates for Philippine Kaloula are lacking, we employ dense population sampling to determine the appropriate evolutionary lineages for diversification analyses. We explicitly take phylogenetic uncertainty into account when calculating diversification and disparification statistics and fitting models of diversification. Following dispersal to the Philippines from Southeast Asia, Kaloula radiated rapidly into several well-supported clades. Morphological variation within Kaloula is partly explained by ecotype and accumulated at high levels during this radiation, including within ecotypes. We pinpoint an axis of morphospace related directly to climbing and digging behaviors and find patterns of phenotypic evolution suggestive of ecological opportunity with partitioning into distinct habitat specialists. We conclude by discussing the components of phenotypic diversity that are likely important in amphibian adaptive radiations.},

@article{Adams:2010tg,
	abstract = {Background: A major goal in evolutionary biology is to understand the evolution of phenotypic diversity. Both natural and sexual selection play a large role in generating phenotypic adaptations, with biomechanical requirements and developmental mechanisms mediating patterns of phenotypic evolution. For many traits, the relative importance of selective and developmental components remains understudied.
Results: We investigated ontogenetic trajectories of foot morphology in the eight species of European plethodontid cave salamander to test the hypothesis that adult foot morphology was adapted for climbing. Using geometric morphometrics and other approaches, we found that developmental patterns in five species displayed little morphological change during growth (isometry), where the extensive interdigital webbing in adults was best explained as the retention of the juvenile morphological state. By contrast, three species exhibited significant allometry, with an increase in interdigital webbing during growth. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that multiple evolutionary transitions between isometry and allometry of foot webbing have occurred in this lineage. Allometric parameters of foot growth were most similar to those of a tropical species previously shown to be adapted for climbing. Finally, interspecific variation in adult foot morphology was significantly reduced as compared to variation among juveniles, indicating that ontogenetic convergence had resulted in a common adult foot morphology across species.
Conclusions: The results presented here provide evidence of a complex history of phenotypic evolution in this clade. The common adult phenotype exhibited among species reveals that selection plays an important part in generating patterns of foot diversity in the group. However, developmental trajectories arriving at this common morphology are distinct; with some species displaying developmental stasis (isometry), while others show an increase in foot webbing during growth. Thus, multiple developmental solutions exist to the same evolutionary challenge. Our findings underscore the importance of examining morphological adaptations from multiple perspectives, and emphasize that both selective hypotheses and developmental processes must be considered for a more comprehensive understanding of phenotypic evolution.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary theory predicts that selection in distinct microhabitats generates correlations between morphological and ecological traits, and may increase both phenotypic and taxonomic diversity. However, some microhabitats exert unique selective pressures that act as a restraining force on macroevolutionary patterns of diversification. In this study, we use phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the evolutionary outcomes of inhabiting the arboreal microhabitat in salamanders. We find that arboreality has independently evolved at least five times in Caudata and has arisen primarily from terrestrial ancestors. However, the rate of transition from arboreality back to terrestriality is 24 times higher than the converse. This suggests that macroevolutionary trends in microhabitat use tend toward terrestriality over arboreality, which influences the extent to which use of the arboreal microhabitat proliferates. Morphologically, we find no evidence for an arboreal phenotype in overall body proportions or in foot shape, as variation in both traits overlaps broadly with species that utilize different microhabitats. However, both body shape and foot shape display reduced rates of phenotypic evolution in arboreal taxa, and evidence of morphological convergence among arboreal lineages is observed. Taken together, these patterns suggest that arboreality has played a unique role in the evolution of this family, providing neither an evolutionary opportunity, nor an evolutionary dead end.
Arboreality is surprisingly common across the family of lungless salamanders, yet it remains unclear how arboreality has influenced the macroevolution of microhabitat use and morphology. We found several independent transitions to arboreality solely from terrestrial ancestors, nearly 60 reversions to terrestrial life from arboreality, decreased rate of morphological evolution, and evidence of convergence of general body proportions and foot shape across arboreal species.},

@article{Bendik:2013vp,
	abstract = {Background: Subterranean faunal radiations can result in complex patterns of morphological divergence involving both convergent or parallel phenotypic evolution and cryptic species diversity. Salamanders of the genus Eurycea in central Texas provide a particularly challenging example with respect to phylogeny reconstruction, biogeography and taxonomy. These predominantly aquatic species inhabit karst limestone aquifers and spring outflows, and exhibit a wide range of morphological and genetic variation. We extensively sampled spring and cave populations of six Eurycea species within this group (eastern Blepsimolge clade), to reconstruct their phylogenetic and biogeographic history using mtDNA and examine patterns and origins of cave- and surface-associated morphological variation.
Results: Genetic divergence is generally low, and many populations share ancestral haplotypes and/or show evidence of introgression. This pattern likely indicates a recent radiation coupled with a complex history of intermittent connections within the aquatic karst system. Cave populations that exhibit the most extreme troglobitic morphologies show no or very low divergence from surface populations and are geographically interspersed among them, suggesting multiple instances of rapid, parallel phenotypic evolution. Morphological variation is diffuse among cave populations; this is in contrast to surface populations, which form a tight cluster in morphospace. Unexpectedly, our analyses reveal two distinct and previously unrecognized morphological groups encompassing multiple species that are not correlated with spring or cave habitat, phylogeny or geography, and may be due to developmental plasticity.
Conclusions: The evolutionary history of this group of spring- and cave-dwelling salamanders reflects patterns of intermittent isolation and gene flow influenced by complex hydrogeologic dynamics that are characteristic of karst regions. Shallow genetic divergences among several species, evidence of genetic exchange, and nested relationships across morphologically disparate cave and spring forms suggests that cave invasion was recent and many troglobitic morphologies arose independently. These patterns are consistent with an adaptive-shift hypothesis of divergence, which has been proposed to explain diversification in other karst fauna. While cave and surface forms often do not appear to be genetically isolated, morphological diversity within and among populations may be maintained by developmental plasticity, selection, or a combination thereof.},

Many studies suggest that much morphological variation is explained by adaptation to different microhabitats. Here, we test whether morphology and microhabitat use are related in plethodontid salamanders, which contain the majority of salamander species, and have radiated into a striking diversity of microhabitats. We obtained microhabitat data for 189 species that also had both morphometric and phylogenetic data. We then tested for associations between morphology and microhabitat categories using phylogenetic comparative methods. Associations between morphology and ecology in plethodontids are largely confined to a single clade within one subfamily (Bolitoglossinae), whereas variation in morphology across other plethodontids is unrelated to microhabitat categories. These results demonstrate that ecological radiation and morphological evolution can be largely decoupled in a major clade. The results also offer a striking contrast to lizards, which typically show close relationships between morphology and microhabitat.},

	abstract = {This study investigates interspecific variation in age at first reproduction, fecundity, and body size in multispecies assemblages of desmognathine salamanders. The hypotheses tested are that interspecific differences in body size among desmognathines stem proximately from variation in age at first reproduction and that variation in the latter trait is positively correlated with variation in fecundity among species. It is shown that a correlation between age at first reproduction and fecundity, combined with a uniform rate of survival, based on available estimates of these parameters, will yield equivalent values of net reproductive rate ( R o) among the species of a given assemblage. Such equivalence represents a form of life-history symmetry. Data from two assemblages are presented in support of the argument for symmetry. Such life-history symmetry may reflect uniformity in morphological specialization in desmognathines. Given the morphological adaptations to burrowing (head-wedging) in the subfamily, the relationship between adult body size and habitat preference in Desmognathus may reflect adaptation to the size of cover objects and composition of the substratum along the aquatic-terrestrial habitat gradient. I propose that these variables, in association with predation and competition, represent the selective factors responsible for body size diversification in Desmognathus.},

Substantial morphological variation in the otic region coupled with great ecological diversity within this clade make plethodontids an excellent model for exploring the ecomorphology of the amphibian ear. We examined the influence of habitat, development, and vision on inner ear morphology in 52 plethodontid species. We collected traditional and 3D geometric morphometric measurements to characterize variation in size and shape of the otic endocast and peripheral structures of the salamander ear. Phylogenetic comparative analyses demonstrate structural convergence in the inner ear across ecologically similar species. Species that dwell in spatially complex microhabitats exhibit robust, highly curved semicircular canals suggesting enhanced vestibular sense, whereas species with reduced visual systems demonstrate reduced canal curvature indicative of relaxed selection on the vestibulo‐ocular reflex. Cave specialists show parallel enlargement of auditory‐associated structures. The morphological correlates of ecology among diverse species reveal underlying evidence of habitat specialization in the inner ear and suggest that there exists physiological variation in the function of the salamander ear even in the apparent absence of selective pressures on the auditory system to support acoustic behavior.},

Using a combination of mitochondrial and microsatellite data, we discovered significant genetic differentiation across the known distribution (ɸST > 0.868 and FST = 0.261−0.652, p < 0.001), and identified at least two highly divergent clades. These clades, referenced herein as the Semlitsch and Type Locality clades, are of late Miocene origin (approximately 5.3 million years old) and are composed of several geographically and genetically distinct populations. Together, our observations suggest that previously unrecognized species-level diversity may exist in P. websteri, with populations potentially representing distinct but undescribed taxa. We hypothesize that divergence within P. websteri likely resulted from a culmination of radical changes in climate, hydrology, and geology over deep time. Moreover, our results add to mounting evidence suggesting that P. websteri does not belong within the P. welleri group, but instead forms its own discrete species complex separate and genetically distant from P. welleri. This study provides a starting point for future work and reiterates that relationships among, and species-level diversity within, eastern species of Plethodon require additional investigation and potential reevaluation.},

	abstract = {Current studies indicate that both processes and mechanisms of natural hybridization go far beyond the formation and maintenance of hybrid zones between species. These studies demonstrate that the evolutionary consequences of hybridization can include extinction or extirpation of lineages but may also favor the formation of new hybrid species in an ecological context. The unambiguous identification of occurrences of hybridization in natural populations is a crucial first step in addressing questions related to natural hybridization in both evolutionary and ecological terms. Here, we provide the first molecular evidence of extensive natural hybridization between two ancient sister species of spectacled salamanders --Salamandrina perspicillata in northern and Salamandrina terdigitata in southern Italy. Parental lineages diverged at least 10 million years ago during the Lower Pliocene and represent the most ancient split between any congeneric amphibian species endemic to the Italian peninsula. Analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cyt b), nuclear‐encoded recombination‐activating protein (RAG‐1) and propriomelanocortin (POMC) genes of more than 250 individuals from populations of both species and from the contact zone, show clear evidence of ongoing hybridization. Whereas 20% of the individuals from the contact population showed no signs of hybridization for the applied markers, the remainder (80%) were identified as first generation hybrids and backcrossed individuals. Our results suggest that hybridization between these two ancient lineages produces viable and fertile offspring, highlighting the need for research on possible mechanisms that prevent the intermixing and hybridization of parental species on a broader geographical scale.},

	abstract = {An important dimension of adaptive radiation is the degree to which diversification rates fluctuate or remain constant through time. Focusing on plethodontid salamanders of the genus Desmognathus, we present a novel synthetic analysis of phylogeographic history, rates of ecomorphological evolution and species accumulation, and community assembly in an adaptive radiation. Dusky salamanders are highly variable in life history, body size, and ecology, with many endemic lineages in the southern Appalachian Highlands of eastern North America. Our results show that life-history evolution had important consequences for the buildup of plethodontid-salamander species richness and phenotypic disparity in eastern North America, a global hot spot of salamander biodiversity. The origin of Desmognathus species with aquatic larvae was followed by a high rate of lineage accumulation, which then gradually decreased toward the present time. The peak period of lineage accumulation in the group coincides with evolutionary partitioning of lineages with aquatic larvae into seepage, stream-edge, and stream microhabitats. Phylogenetic simulations demonstrate a strong correlation between morphology and microhabitat ecology independent of phylogenetic effects and suggest that ecomorphological changes are concentrated early in the radiation of Desmognathus. Deep phylogeographic fragmentation within many codistributed ecomorph clades suggests long-term persistence of ecomorphological features and stability of endemic lineages and communities through multiple climatic cycles. Phylogenetic analyses of community structure show that ecomorphological divergence promotes the coexistence of lineages and that repeated, independent evolution of microhabitat-associated ecomorphs has a limited role in the evolutionary assembly of Desmognathus communities. Comparing and contrasting our results to other adaptive radiations having different biogeographic histories, our results suggest that rates of diversification during adaptive radiation are intimately linked to the degree to which community structure persists over evolutionary time.},

Dozens of studies focused on geographic patterns of phenotypic and genetic variation have been conducted on plethodontids, such that we now have a deep understanding of how many species are in the family and where they occur. This body of work on patterns of speciation has been foundational to exploring the drivers of the major patterns of species richness in the family. Approximately 70% of the world's 696 extant species of salamanders are plethodontids. The distribution of plethodontid species diversity exhibits striking variation globally. Most plethodontids are concentrated into two hotspots of diversity, the Appalachian Highlands and the Mesoamerican Highlands. Moreover, within these montane centers of diversity more species are found in midelevation habitats than at the highest or lowest elevations. The clade has been highly successful in the New World tropics, which harbors more plethodontid species than the temperate zone. Here, I review new insights on the evolutionary and ecological causes of variation in plethodontid species richness over geographic space and evolutionary time. New hypotheses on the phylogenetic relationships of plethodonids and tools from comparative phylogenetics and biodiversity informatics have been critical to this recent progress. Threats to plethodontid diversity arising from global climate change are examined, as is the need to further study and to cross-validate forecasts of species' range dynamics with different modeling approaches and independent data.},

oregonensis is represented by two unrelated, phenotypically similar clades, both of which possess substantial substructure of their own. The subspecies
xanthoptica includes two lineages that differ in phenotype, one of which has colonized the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The subspecies
eschscholtzii occurs mainly to the south, but some populations from a northern lineage extend into the Monterey Bay region, where they approach
xanthoptica geographically. In sum, populations in the central coastal California region form a distributional patchwork, including three subspecies, three clades (which differ from the three subspecies), and ten haplotype lineages.

	abstract = {Cave organisms occupy a special place in evolutionary biology because convergent morphologies of many species demonstrate repeatability in evolution even as they obscure phylogenetic relationships. The origin of specialized cave‐dwelling species also raises the issue of the relative importance of isolation vs. natural selection in speciation. Two alternative hypotheses describe the origin of subterranean species. The `climate‐relict' model proposes allopatric speciation after populations of cold‐adapted species become stranded in caves due to climate change. The `adaptive‐shift' model proposes parapatric speciation driven by divergent selection between subterranean and surface habitats. Our study of the Tennessee cave salamander complex shows that the three nominal forms (Gyrinophilus palleucus palleucus, G. p. necturoides, and G. gulolineatus) arose recently and are genealogically nested within the epigean (surface‐dwelling) species, G. porphyriticus. Short branch lengths and discordant gene trees were consistent with a complex history involving gene flow between diverging forms. Results of coalescent‐based analysis of the distribution of haplotypes among groups reject the allopatric speciation model and support continuous or recurrent genetic exchange during divergence. These results strongly favour the hypothesis that Tennessee cave salamanders originated from spring salamanders via divergence with gene flow.},

	abstract = {Whether hybridization generates or erodes species diversity has long been debated, but to date most studies have been conducted at small taxonomic scales. Salamanders (order Caudata) represent a taxonomic order in which hybridization plays a prevalent ecological and evolutionary role. We employed a recently developed model of trait-dependent diversification to test the hypothesis that hybridization impacts the diversification dynamics of species that are currently hybridizing. We find strong evidence supporting this hypothesis, showing that hybridizing salamander lineages have significantly greater net-diversification rates than non-hybridizing lineages. This pattern is driven by concurrently increased speciation rates and decreased extinction rates in hybridizing lineages. Our results support the hypothesis that hybridization can act as a generative force in macroevolutionary diversification.},

@article{Rovito:2010uo,
	abstract = {Peripatric speciation and the importance of founder effects have long been controversial, and multilocus sequence data and coalescent methods now allow hypotheses of peripatric speciation to be tested in a rigorous manner. Using a multilocus phylogeographical data set for two species of salamanders (genus Hydromantes) from the Sierra Nevada of California, hypotheses of recent divergence by peripatric speciation and older, allopatric divergence were tested. Phylogeographical analysis revealed two divergent lineages within Hydromantes platycephalus, which were estimated to have diverged in the Pliocene. By contrast, a low‐elevation species, Hydromantes brunus, diverged from within the northern lineage of H. platycephalus much more recently (mid‐Pleistocene), during a time of major climatic change in the Sierra Nevada. Multilocus species tree estimation and coalescent estimates of divergence time, migration rate, and growth rate reject a scenario of ancient speciation of H. brunus with subsequent gene flow and introgression from H. platycephalus, instead supporting a more recent divergence with population expansion. Although the small, peripheral distribution of H. brunus suggests the possibility of peripatric speciation, the estimated founding population size of the species was too large to have allowed founder effects to be important in its divergence. These results provide evidence for both recent speciation, most likely tied to the climatic changes of the Pleistocene, and older lineage divergence, possibly due to geological events, and add to evidence that Pleistocene glacial cycles were an important driver of diversification in the Sierra Nevada.},

	abstract = {The Neotropical bolitoglossine salamanders represent an impressive adaptive radiation, comprising roughly 40% of global salamander species diversity. Despite decades of morphological studies and molecular work, a robust multilocus phylogenetic hypothesis based on DNA sequence data is lacking for the group. We estimated species trees based on multilocus nuclear and mitochondrial data for all major lineages within the bolitoglossines, and used our new phylogenetic hypothesis to test traditional biogeographical scenarios and hypotheses of morphological evolution in the group. In contrast to previous phylogenies, our results place all Central American endemic genera in a single clade and suggest that Central America played a critical role in the early biogeographical history of the group. The large, predominantly Mexican genus Pseudoeurycea is paraphyletic, and analyses of the nuclear data place two lineages of Pseudoeurycea as the sister group of Bolitoglossa. Our phylogeny reveals extensive homoplasy in morphological characters, which may be the result of truncation or alteration of a shared developmental trajectory. We used our phylogenetic results to revise the taxonomy of the genus Pseudoeurycea. {\copyright} 2015 The Linnean Society of London},

@article{Steinfartz:2007vk,
	abstract = {Mechanisms and processes of ecologically driven adaptive speciation are best studied in natural situations where the splitting process is still occurring, i.e. before complete reproductive isolation is achieved. Here, we present a case of an early stage of adaptive differentiation under sympatric conditions in the fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra, that allows inferring the underlying processes for the split. Larvae of S. salamandra normally mature in small streams until metamorphosis, but in an old, continuous forest area near Bonn (the Kottenforst), we found salamander larvae not only in small streams but also in shallow ponds, which are ecologically very different from small streams. Common‐environment experiments with larvae from both habitat types reveal specific adaptations to these different ecological conditions. Mitochondrial and microsatellite analyses show that the two ecologically differentiated groups also show signs of genetic differentiation. A parallel analysis of animals from a neighbouring much larger forest area (the Eifel), in which larvae mature only in streams, shows no signs of genetic differentiation, indicating that gene flow between ecologically similar types can occur over large distances. Hence, geographical factors cannot explain the differential larval habitat adaptations in the Kottenforst, in particular since adult life and mating of S. salamandra is strictly terrestrial and not associated with larval habitats. We propose therefore that the evolution of these adaptations was coupled with the evolution of cues for assortative mating which would be in line with models of sympatric speciation that suggest a co‐evolution of habitat adaptations and associated mating signals.},

	abstract = {Continental islands offer an excellent opportunity to investigate adaptive processes and to time microevolutionary changes that precede macroevolutionary events. We performed a population genetic study of the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), a species that displays unique intraspecific diversity of reproductive strategies, to address the microevolutionary processes leading to phenotypic and genetic differentiation of island, coastal and interior populations. We used eight microsatellite markers to estimate genetic diversity, population structure and demographic parameters in viviparous insular populations and ovoviviparous coastal and interior populations. Our results show considerable genetic differentiation (FST range: 0.06-0.27), and no clear signs of gene flow among populations, except between the large and admixed interior populations. We find no support for island colonization by rafting or intentional/accidental anthropogenic introductions, indicating that rising sea levels were responsible for isolation of the island populations approximately 9000 years ago. Our study provides evidence of rapid genetic differentiation between island and coastal populations, and rapid evolution of viviparity driven by climatic selective pressures on island populations, geographic isolation with genetic drift, or a combination of these factors. Studies of these viviparous island populations in early stages of divergence help us better understand the microevolutionary processes involved in rapid phenotypic shifts.

	abstract = {Tailed amphibians, or salamanders, occur in the tropics only in the New World, where they are concentrated primarily in Middle America and northwestern South America. All are members of the family Plethodontidae, the lungless salamanders. As recently as 1926 only 30 species of tropical salamanders were known, and all were placed in a single genus. Today 11 genera are recognized. All occur in Middle America, and over 140 species have been described. Many local tropical regions are very rich in numbers of species, and as many as 21 species may be present along a single altitudinal gradient. Community organization of species of salamanders in the tropics differs from that in temperate regions in that species of tropical salamanders tend to be segregated into discrete elevational zones, with any given species restricted to a narrow elevational band. Within elevational zones, species are segregated by major habitat type, then by microhabitat, body size, and finally trophic and behavioral features. Cloud forests at middle elevations, from about 750 m to 2,500 m, are especially rich in salamanders, in both diversity and density. In Nuclear Central America nearly 50% of arboreal bromeliads in a local sample (N = 903) contained salamanders. Some species are found almost exclusively in bromeliads, and over 30 salamanders have been encountered in a single bromeliad. Farther south, in Costa Rica, cloud forests harbor salamanders in bromeliads as well as in arboreal and terrestrial moss mats. Extreme microhabitat specialization enriches the Costa Rican fauna to the maximum number of species present locally anywhere in the tropics. In the relatively lower latitudes (e.g., Costa Rica and Panama) the proportion of species occurring at lower elevations increases compared with Mexican and Guatemalan transects. Bromeliads and moss mats in the mid-elevational wet and rain forests are ideal microhabitats for these insectivorous, direct developing amphibians. Bromeliads offer abundant food resources, egg deposition sites, protection from predation, and microenvironments buffered against temperature extremes and low humidity. Salamanders are top carnivores in the bromeliad microhabitat. The extensive adaptive radiation of plethodontid salamanders in Middle America has featured both convergent and parallel evolution. The mid-elevational cloud forests, with their rich epiphytic assemblages and highly dissected topography, have been of great significance in speciation, morphological and behavioral diversification, geographical ecology, and historical biogeography of tropical plethodontid salamanders.},

	abstract = {Aim
Spelerpini is a major radiation in the Plethodontidae, the largest family of salamanders. Seventy‐five percent of its species richness occurs in Eurycea, one of its six genera. We hypothesized that this was the result of the transgression of the Western Interior Seaway that provided ecological opportunity via ancestral range expansion into novel geographical regions, leading to an adaptive radiation.
Location
Eastern North America.
Methods
We sampled all but one species and two subspecies of extant Spelerpini, including several putative species, for four genes using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference approaches to generate a comprehensive, robust phylogeny. We used five fossil calibrations to generate a chronogram, a likelihood framework to estimate the ancestral ranges/splits of all nodes on the phylogeny, and a Bayesian inference method to estimate diversification rate shifts putting the evolution of this group into a historical biogeographical context.
Results
A well‐resolved, strongly supported phylogeny of the Spelerpini was recovered. Eurycea is among the oldest genera within the Spelerpini, originating c. 42 Ma with an ancestor occurring in four of five physiographical regions, each corresponding to a major Eurycea lineage. There is strong support for a rate shift in the Edwards Plateau neotenic Eurycea.
Main conclusions
A pattern of niche lability was found in the Spelerpini, as opposed to a pattern of niche conservatism found in other major radiations of plethodontids in eastern North America. The genus Eurycea dispersed widely into novel regions experiencing ecological opportunity as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed. This represents the first fossil calibrated and the most thoroughly sampled phylogeny of the group to date.},

   Thermochronologic results indicate that emplacement of granodiorites
   closely coincided with retrogression of the metamorphic basement and

Verbal descriptions are available for an additional American genus, Myersiella, and for the Asiatic genera Uperodon, Kalophrynus, Chaperina, and Metaphrynella. Carvalho's (1954) suggested affinities among New World genera are confirmed from comparisons of mating calls for several groups: Dermatonotus, Elachistocleis, Hypopachus, and Gastrophryne; Glossostoma and Dermatonotus; Synapturanus and Myersiella; and Stereocyclops, Ctenophryne, and Chiasmocleis. Such intergeneric similarities in call are unusual and may reflect either an extended range of applicability of call data or relatively fine intergeneric taxonomic distinctions. However, the calls of Hamptophryne, Arcovomer, and Dasypops do not match Carvalho's (1954) suggested affinities. Among forms with similar calls, those having a larger body size usually have lower dominant frequencies. Genera in which the males call from dispersed sites (terrestrial nests, land-crab burrows, or tree holes) have calls that are high-pitched short, relatively pure, single notes. They thus have the properties suggested by other authors (e.g., Marler, 1955) as minimizing locatability by predators.},

   distribution and diverse biology make them well-suited for assessing
   fundamental questions in evolution, ecology, and conservation. However,
   despite their scientific importance, the evolutionary history and tempo
   of frog diversification remain poorly understood. By using a molecular
   dataset of unprecedented size, including 88-kb characters from 95
   nuclear genes of 156 frog species, in conjunction with 20 fossil-based
   calibrations, our analyses result in the most strongly supported
   phylogeny of all major frog lineages and provide a timescale of frog
   evolution that suggests much younger divergence times than suggested by
   earlier studies. Unexpectedly, our divergence-time analyses show that
   three species-rich clades (Hyloidea, Microhylidae, and Natatanura),
   which together comprise similar to 88\% of extant anuran species,
   simultaneously underwent rapid diversification at the
   Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary (KPB). Moreover, anuran families
   and subfamilies containing arboreal species originated near or after the
   KPB. These results suggest that the K-Pg mass extinction may have
   triggered explosive radiations of frogs by creating new ecological
   opportunities. This phylogeny also reveals relationships such as
   Microhylidae being sister to all other ranoid frogs and African
   continental lineages of Natatanura forming a clade that is sister to a
   clade of Eurasian, Indian, Melanesian, and Malagasy lineages.
   Biogeographical analyses suggest that the ancestral area of modern frogs
   was Africa, and their current distribution is largely associated with
   the breakup of Pangaea and subsequent Gondwanan fragmentation.}},

	abstract = {{Theory predicts that clades diversifying via sympatric speciation will
   exhibit high diversification rates. However, the expected rate of
   diversification in clades characterized by allopatric speciation is less
   clear. Previous studies have documented significantly higher speciation
   rates in freshwater fish clades diversifying via sympatric versus
   allopatric modes, leading to suggestions that the geographic pattern of
   speciation can be inferred solely from knowledge of the diversification
   rate. We tested this prediction using an example from darters, a clade
   of approximately 200 species of freshwater fishes endemic to eastern
   North America. A resolved phylogeny was generated using mitochondrial
   DNA gene sequences for logperches, a monophyletic group of darters
   composed of 10 recognized species. Divergence times among logperch
   species were estimated using a fossil calibrated molecular clock in
   centrarchid fishes, and diversification rates in logperches were
   estimated using several methods. Speciation events in logperches are
   recent, extending from 4.20 +/- 1.06 million years ago (mya) to 0.42 +/-
   0.22 mya, with most speciation events occurring in the Pleistocene.
   Diversification rates are high in logperches, at some nodes exceeding
   rates reported for well-studied adaptive radiations such as Hawaiian
   silverswords. The geographic pattern of speciation in logperches was
   investigated by examining the relationship between degree of sympatry
   and the absolute age of the contrast, with the result that
   diversification in logperches appears allopatric. The very high
   diversification rate observed in the logperch phylogeny is more similar
   to freshwater fish clades thought to represent examples of sympatric
   speciation than to clades representing allopatric speciation. These
   results demonstrate that the geographic mode of speciation for a clade
   cannot be inferred from the diversification rate. The empirical
   observation of high diversification rates in logperches demonstrates
   that allopatric speciation can occur rapidly.}},

	abstract = {{How many species one recognizes within a given taxon remains a difficult
   question, especially when morphology is relatively stable or when clinal
   variation is present, thus complicating diagnosis. I accept the general
   lineage concept of species, and my goal is to recognize historically
   distinct evolutionary lineages that are likely to remain distinct. Here
   I analyze this task with respect to patterns of species formation in two
   genera of plethodontid salamanders in California. Ensatina is a ring
   species complex surrounding the Central Valley of California. At present
   it is a single species with seven subspecies that are linked by apparent
   clinal variation in intergrade zones, but there are also some narrow
   hybrid zones where morphologically and ecologically differentiated forms
   interact. In contrast, Batrachoseps, which has much the same
   distribution, has about 20 species in California, most occurring in
   sympatry with Ensatina. Divergence in the two taxa is based on two
   fundamentally different phenomena, and yet there are some common themes.
   Adaptive divergence in coloration is the dominant theme in Ensatina,
   whereas differentiation is largely perceived at the molecular level in
   Batrachoseps. Yet both have evolved in the same region and have been
   affected by many of the same climatic and earth historical phenomena.
   Within the Ensatina complex, different adaptations related to predator
   avoidance have evolved. Coloration has diverged in different directions
   in coastal and inland populations, even though genetic interactions
   continue to take place. Where coastal populations meet other coastal
   populations, ecologically and morphologically similar populations merge
   genetically, even if well differentiated in molecular traits. In
   contrast, where the ring is crossed and where ecologically and
   morphologically differentiated populations meet, they hybridize narrowly
   or are sympatric and behave as if they are species. Within the ring-like
   distribution, clinal patterns of variation occur. The current polytypic
   taxonomy is retained, even though it is problematic, because
   alternatives are even less appropriate. In contrast, where genetically
   differentiated populations of Batrachoseps meet they typically do not
   merge. Instead, they replace one another spatially, in part because they
   are so similar ecologically. Apparently the periods of isolation were
   sufficiently long that even in the absence of adaptive divergence there
   has been divergence of isolating mechanisms. Analysis of patterns of
   genetic differentiation in allozymes and mtDNA in relation to the
   geological history of California is used to generate biogeographic
   scenarios to help explain the contrast between Batrachoseps and
   Ensatina.}},

	abstract = {{Understanding how and why certain clades diversify greatly in morphology
   whereas others do not remains a major theme in evolutionary biology.
   Projecting families of phylogenies into multivariate morphospaces can
   distinguish two scenarios potentially leading to unequal morphological
   diversification: unequal magnitude of change per phylogenetic branch,
   and unequal efficiency in morphological innovation. This approach is
   demonstrated using a case study of skulls in sister clades within the
   South American fish superfamily Anostomoidea. Unequal morphological
   diversification in this system resulted not from the morphologically
   diverse clade changing more on each phylogenetic branch, but from that
   clade distributing an equal amount of change more widely through
   morphospace and innovating continually. Although substantial
   morphological evolution occurred throughout the less diverse clade's
   history, most of that clade's expansion in morphospace occurred in the
   most basal branches, and more derived portions of that radiation
   oscillated within previously explored limits. Because simulations
   revealed that there is a maximum 2.7\% probability of generating two
   clades that differ so greatly in the density of lineages within
   morphospace under a null Brownian model, the observed difference in
   pattern likely reflects a difference in the underlying evolutionary
   process. Clade-specific factors that may have promoted or arrested
   morphological diversification are discussed.}},

   are often less diverse by comparison. However, reduced complexity of
   island communities can also present ecological opportunities. For
   example, amphibian diversity on Sulawesi Island is lower than it is in
   the Philippines, but Sulawesi supports a surprising diversity of
   Sulawesi fanged frogs (Limnonectes). Here we examine molecular,
   morphological, and geographical variation of fanged frogs from these two
   regions. Using genealogical concordance, morphology, and a Bayesian
   approach to species delimitation, we identified 13 species on Sulawesi,
   only four of which have been previously described. After evolutionary
   history is accounted for, a model with multiple body size optima in
   sympatric species is favored over a ``random-walk{''} model of body size
   evolution. Additionally, morphological variation is higher among
   sympatric than nonsympatric species on Sulawesi but not in the
   Philippines. These findings suggest that adaptive radiation of fanged
   frogs on Sulawesi was driven by natural selection to infiltrate
   ecological niches occupied by other frog lineages in the Philippines.
   This supports a role of ecological opportunity in community assembly:
   diversification in mature communities, such as the Philippines, is
   limited by a dearth of unoccupied ecological niches. On Sulawesi,
   evolutionary novelties originated in a predictable and replicated
   fashion in response to opportunities presented by a depauperate
   ancestral community.}},

   little or no effect on speciation, or even a negative effect. Many
   classic examples of adaptive radiation' appear to involve effects driven
   partly by geographic speciation, species' dispersal abilities, and the

   in the genus Calopteryx is caused by nonadaptive divergence in
   coloration and behaviour affecting premating isolation, and structural
   differentiation in reproductive morphology affecting postmating
   isolation. Similarly, the vast majority of diversification events in the
   sister genera Enallagma and Ischnura are entirely driven by
   differentiation in genital structures used in species recognition. The

   differing opinions concerning its definition and nature among
   researchers studying a wide diversity of systems. Here, we take a broad
   view of what constitutes an adaptive radiation, and seek to find
   commonalities among disparate examples, ranging from plants to
   invertebrate and vertebrate animals, and remote islands to lakes and
   continents, to better understand processes shared across adaptive
   radiations. We surveyed many groups to evaluate factors considered
   important in a large variety of species radiations. In each of these
   studies, ecological opportunity of some form is identified as a
   prerequisite for adaptive radiation. However, evolvability, which can be
   enhanced by hybridization between distantly related species, may play a
   role in seeding entire radiations. Within radiations, the processes that
   lead to speciation depend largely on (1) whether the primary drivers of
   ecological shifts are (a) external to the membership of the radiation
   itself (mostly divergent or disruptive ecological selection) or (b) due
   to competition within the radiation membership (interactions among
   members) subsequent to reproductive isolation in similar environments,
   and (2) the extent and timing of admixture. These differences translate

   a recurrent challenge in evolutionary biology, particularly for

   evolutionary rates, which raises the question of whether adaptive or
   non/adaptive processes were predominantly involved when they rapidly
   diversified after migrating from temperate regions into the tropical
   mountains. Indeed, fine-scale phylogenetic relationships within several
   conifer genus remain under debate. Here, we studied the phylogenetic
   relationships of endemic firs (Abies, Pinaceae) discontinuously
   distributed in the montane forests from the Southwestern United States
   to Guatemala, and addressed several hypotheses related to adaptive and
   non-adaptive radiations. We derived over 80 K SNPs from genotyping by
   sequencing (GBS) for 45 individuals of nine Mesoamerican species to
   perform phylogenetic analyses. Both Maximum Likelihood and
   quartets-inference phylogenies resulted in a well-resolved topology,
   showing a single fir lineage divided in four subgroups that coincided
   with the main mountain ranges of Mesoamerica; thus having important
   taxonomic implications. Such subdivision fitted a North-South isolation
   by distance framework, in which non-adaptive allopatric processes seemed
   the rule. Interestingly, several reticulations were observed within
   subgroups, especially in the central-south region, which may explain
   past difficulties for generating infrageneric phylogenies. Further
   evidence for non-adaptive processes was obtained from analyses of 21
   candidate-gene regions, which exhibited diminishing values of ?a/?s and
   Ka/Ks with latitude, thus indicating reduced efficiency of purifying
   selection towards the Equator. Our study indicates that nonadaptive

@article{Guenther:2001,
	abstract = {Abstract Based on morphological, anatomical, ecological, ethological, and molecular traits, two new genera of microhylid frogs from mainland New Guinea are described. Metamagnusia gen. n. includes two species, M. marani sp. n., the type species found in the Wondiwoi Mountains at the base of the Wandammen Peninsula (Papua Province, Indonesia), and M. slateri (Loveridge, 1955) comb. n., from eastern New Guinea (Papua New Guinea). The second new genus, Pseudocallulops gen. n., also includes two species, P. eurydactylus (Zweifel, 1972) comb. n. from the Fakfak Mountains on the Bomberai Peninsula (Papua Province, Indonesia), and P. pullifer (G{\"u}nther, 2006) comb. n., which is designated as the type species and which occurs in the Wondiwoi Mountains at the base of the Wandammen Peninsula. Both new genera belong to the group of asterophryine genera with a symphignathine state of the maxillary bones. Metamagnusia gen. n. is most closely related to the genus Asterophrys, while Pseudocallulops gen. n. forms a sister-clade of the taxa Asterophrys + Metamagnusia. The new genera are erected to recognize their differences in fundamental traits from the presently recognized genera. Another goal was to dissolve polyphyletic taxa and to avoid creation of paraphyletic taxa within the symphignathine genera of the Australopapuan microhylids.

	abstract = {A central paradigm in island biogeography has been the unidirectional {\textquotedblleft}downstream{\textquotedblright} colonization of islands from continents (source to sink) based on the idea that less-diverse island communities are easier to invade than biologically more-diverse continental communities. Recently, several cases of {\textquotedblleft}upstream{\textquotedblright} colonization (from islands to continents) have been documented, challenging the traditional view. However, all these cases have involved individual island species that have colonized mainland regions. Here, using molecular phylogenetic data, divergence time estimates, lineage diversity distributions, and ancestral area analyses, we reconstruct the spread of a species-rich (\&gt;700 species) passerine bird radiation (core Corvoidea) from its late Eocene/Oligocene origin in the emerging proto-Papuan archipelago north of Australia, including multiple colonizations from the archipelago to Southeast Asia. Thus, islands apparently provided the setting for the initiation of a major songbird radiation that subsequently invaded all other continents. Morphological and behavioral adaptations of the core Corvoidea as generalist feeders in open habitats, which facilitated dispersal and colonization, apparently evolved in the descendants of sedentary forest birds that invaded the proto-Papuan archipelago. The archipelago evidently provided islands of the right size, number, and proximity to continental areas to support the adaptation and diversification of vagile colonizers that went on to increase avian diversity on a global scale.},

	abstract = { Information on the origin of distribution patterns shown by freshwater invertebrates in the Indo-Australian Archipelago is poor. Here we present a molecular based hypothesis of the phylogenetic relationships of Argiolestidae, a family of damselflies found throughout the tropical parts of the Eastern Hemisphere. We use this to address the following questions: (1) did Argiolestidae colonize Wallacea and the Philippines from the Eurasian or from the Australian continent? (2) Is the presence of Argiolestidae in New Guinea the result of a single colonization event, i.e. are the Argiolestidae found in New Guinea monophyletic? The results show that clades occurring in the Philippines, Wallacea and New Guinea all originate from Australian ancestors. Representatives in Sundaland are most closely related to African genera and failed to reach the Philippines and Wallacea. The presence of Argiolestidae north of Australia is the result of at least three colonization events from Australia to areas that presently compose New Guinea and probably a fourth from Australia to Sulawesi. The two most diverse lineages found north of Australia show different distribution patterns. One reaching north as far as Luzon, presumably facilitated by Late Oligocene to Miocene islands arcs (Melanesian Arc System). The other clade shows a diversification of two genera and numerous species in the eastern tail of New Guinea, an area largely corresponding with the East Papuan Composite Terrane (EPCT) followed by the expansion of one genus into the rest of New Guinea. The EPCT's importance as source area for the New Guinean fauna has been suggested on the basis of distribution patterns, but we present the first evidence based on phylogeny reconstruction of strong diversification on this formerly isolated landmass. },

	abstract = {Amphibia comprises over 7000 extant species distributed in almost every
   ecosystem on every continent except Antarctica. Most species also show
   high specificity for particular habitats, biomes, or climatic niches,
   seemingly rendering long-distance dispersal unlikely. Indeed, many
   lineages still seem to show the signature of their Pangaean origin,
   approximately 300 Ma later. To date, no study has attempted a
   large-scale historical-biogeographic analysis of the group to understand
   the distribution of extant lineages. Here, I use an updated chronogram
   containing 3309 species (similar to 45\% of extant diversity) to
   reconstruct their movement between 12 global ecoregions. I find that
   Pangaean origin and subsequent Laurasian and Gondwanan fragmentation
   explain a large proportion of patterns in the distribution of extant
   species. However, dispersal during the Cenozoic, likely across land
   bridges or short distances across oceans, has also exerted a strong
   influence. Finally, there are at least three strongly supported
   instances of long-distance oceanic dispersal between former Gondwanan
   landmasses during the Cenozoic. Extinction from intervening areas seems
   to be a strong factor in shaping present-day distributions. Dispersal
   and extinction from and between ecoregions are apparently tied to the
   evolution of extraordinarily adaptive expansion-oriented phenotypes that
   allow lineages to easily colonize new areas and diversify, or
   conversely, to extremely specialized phenotypes or heavily relictual
   climatic niches that result in strong geographic localization and
   limited diversification.},

	abstract = {Aims To examine species richness patterns in Papua New Guinea's
   terrestrial vertebrates and test for geographical congruence between the
   four classes, and between lizard and snake subgroups. To assess the
   environmental correlates of Papua New Guinean terrestrial-vertebrate
   richness, and contrast effects of varying analytical resolution and
   correction for spatial autocorrelation. We predict congruence in the
   bird, mammal and to a lesser extent amphibian richness, with weak
   congruence or incongruence between reptiles and the other taxonomic
   groups. We further predict these patterns will stem from relative or in
   the case of reptiles dissimilar, correlative trends with environmental
   predictors such as elevation and temperature.
   Location Papua New Guinea.
   Methods Having created and updated distribution maps for reptiles, we
   compare them with known ranges of amphibians, birds and mammals and
   generate species richness grids at quarter-, half- and one- degree
   spatial resolutions. We examine congruence in species richness between
   vertebrate groups and between reptile subgroups. We employed
   spreading-dye models to simulate species richness according to eight
   environmental predictors and one random model. We accounted for spatial
   autocorrelation in all analyses.
   Results Papua New Guinean amphibian, bird and mammal species richness
   are spatially congruent, a trend which strengthens with decreasing
   spatial resolution. Reptiles and the lizard and snake subgroups reveal
   remarkably different spatial-richness trends. Elevational predictors,
   particularly elevational range at coarse resolutions, provide the
   strongest correlates of species richness. Terrestrial-vertebrate
   richness increases with elevation, whereas reptile richness decreases.
   Main conclusions Congruent species richness gradients in Papua New
   Guinea are observed in most terrestrial vertebrates, except reptiles.
   Topographic heterogeneity and associated climatic clines promote
   diversity in most terrestrial vertebrates but appear to strongly
   constrain reptile diversity. The topographical complexity and climatic
   stratification of tropical mountains clearly present a wealth of
   opportunities for diversification in most terrestrial vertebrate groups.
   As reptiles are strongly constrained by temperature, tropical mountains
   present more of a diversification barrier for them.},

	abstract = {The fig (Moraceae) and pollinating fig wasp (Agaonidae) mutualism is
   best known as a model system for the study of coevolution in
   plant-pollinator interactions and its central role in shaping vertebrate
   communities in tropical forests. Figs also host myriad antagonistic
   parasitic fig wasps which impose costs on both partners threatening
   mutualism stability. Spatiotemporal variation in parasitic wasp
   abundance is a key factor in mitigating these effects. Because fig wasps
   are temperature sensitive and likely vary in their ability to traverse
   environmental gradients, we expect community assemblages and abundance
   of both pollinating and non-pollinating fig wasps to respond to changes
   along an elevational gradient. In the present study, we compare the fig
   wasp communities and abundance of three fig species growing along the
   slopes of the Mount Wilhelm altitudinal gradient in Papua New Guinea. We
   quantified wasps from over 100 male fig trees and calculated seed set
   for 55 female trees along each of the species' distribution on the
   transect. Our results show that the abundance of both pollinating and
   non-pollinating fig wasps follow a mid-elevation peak, consistent with
   fig species richness found in the same transect. The patterns, however,
   are different according to the host's species distribution. Seed set
   remained relatively constant along the gradient for all species with
   some decrease along higher elevations, potentially affecting
   connectivity along the gradient. As suggested for insects in general,
   temperature and habitat diversity appear to play a fundamental role in
   the species richness and abundance of fig wasps.},

@article{Agnarsson:2008im,
	abstract = {We perform Bayesian phylogenetic analyses on cytochrome b sequences from 264 of the 290 extant cetartiodactyl mammals (whales plus even-toed ungulates) and two recently extinct species, the 'Mouse Goat' and the 'Irish Elk'. Previous primary analyses have included only a small portion of the species diversity within Cetartiodactyla, while a complete supertree analysis lacks resolution and branch lengths limiting its utility for comparative studies. The benefits of using a single-gene approach include rapid phylogenetic estimates for a large number of species. However, single-gene phylogenies often differ dramatically from studies involving multiple datasets suggesting that they often are unreliable. However, based on recovery of benchmark clades-clades supported in prior studies based on multiple independent datasets-and recovery of undisputed traditional taxonomic groups, Cytb performs extraordinarily well in resolving cetartiodactyl phylogeny when taxon sampling is dense. Missing data, however, (taxa with partial sequences) can compromise phylogenetic accuracy, suggesting a tradeoff between the benefits of adding taxa and introducing question marks. In the full data, a few species with a short sequences appear misplaced, however, sequence length alone seems a poor predictor of this phenomenon as other taxa with equally short sequences were not conspicuously misplaced. Although we recommend awaiting a better supported phylogeny based on more character data to reconsider classification and taxonomy within Cetartiodactyla, the new phylogenetic hypotheses provided here represent the currently best available tool for comparative species-level studies within this group. Cytb has been sequenced for a large percentage of mammals and appears to be a reliable phylogenetic marker as long as taxon sampling is dense. Therefore, an opportunity exists now to reconstruct detailed phylogenies of most of the major mammalian clades to rapidly provide much needed tools for species-level comparative studies.

	abstract = {Reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC) is a technique for simultaneously evaluating multiple related (but not necessarily nested) statistical models that has recently been applied to the problem of phylogenetic model selection. Here we use a simulation approach to assess the performance of this method and compare it to Akaike weights, a measure of model uncertainty that is based on the Akaike information criterion. Under conditions where the assumptions of the candidate models matched the generating conditions, both Bayesian and AIC-based methods perform well. The 95% credible interval contained the generating model close to 95% of the time. However, the size of the credible interval differed with the Bayesian credible set containing approximately 25% to 50% fewer models than an AIC-based credible interval. The posterior probability was a better indicator of the correct model than the Akaike weight when all assumptions were met but both measures performed similarly when some model assumptions were violated. Models in the Bayesian posterior distribution were also more similar to the generating model in their number of parameters and were less biased in their complexity. In contrast, Akaike-weighted models were more distant from the generating model and biased towards slightly greater complexity. The AIC-based credible interval appeared to be more robust to the violation of the rate homogeneity assumption. Both AIC and Bayesian approaches suggest that substantial uncertainty can accompany the choice of model for phylogenetic analyses, suggesting that alternative candidate models should be examined in analysis of phylogenetic data.},

	abstract = {The uneven distribution of species richness is a fundamental and unexplained pattern of vertebrate biodiversity. Although species richness in groups like mammals, birds, or teleost fishes is often attributed to accelerated cladogenesis, we lack a quantitative conceptual framework for identifying and comparing the exceptional changes of tempo in vertebrate evolutionary history. We develop MEDUSA, a stepwise approach based upon the Akaike information criterion for detecting multiple shifts in birth and death rates on an incompletely resolved phylogeny. We apply MEDUSA incompletely to a diversity tree summarizing both evolutionary relationships and species richness of 44 major clades of jawed vertebrates. We identify 9 major changes in the tempo of gnathostome diversification; the most significant of these lies at the base of a clade that includes most of the coral-reef associated fishes as well as cichlids and perches. Rate increases also underlie several well recognized tetrapod radiations, including most modern birds, lizards and snakes, ostariophysan fishes, and most eutherian mammals. In addition, we find that large sections of the vertebrate tree exhibit nearly equal rates of origination and extinction, providing some of the first evidence from molecular data for the importance of faunal turnover in shaping biodiversity. Together, these results reveal living vertebrate biodiversity to be the product of volatile turnover punctuated by 6 accelerations responsible for >85\% of all species as well as 3 slowdowns that have produced ''living fossils." In addition, by revealing the timing of the exceptional pulses of vertebrate diversification as well as the clades that experience them, our diversity tree provides a framework for evaluating particular causal hypotheses of vertebrate radiations.},

The oldest fossils generally fall in the time range from 70-50 Myr ago, with no earlier finds. If the molecular results are correct, then the first half of the fossil record of modern birds and mammals is missing. Suggestions that this early history was played out in unexplored parts of the world, or that the early progenitors were obscure forms, are unlikely. Intense collecting over hundreds of years has failed to identify these missing fossils. Control experiments, in the form of numerous Cretaceous-age fossil localities which yield excellently preserved lizards, salamanders, birds, and mammals, fail to show the modern forms. The most likely explanation is that they simply did not exist, and that the molecular clock runs fast during major radiations. BioEssays 21:1043-1051, 1999. (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The Hawaiian Drosophila offer a unique opportunity to examine evolutionary questions because of the known ages of the Hawaiian Islands and the large number of species endemic to this archipelago. One of the more well studied groups of Hawaiian Drosophila is the planitibia species group, a long-standing population genetic model system. Here we present a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis of all 17 taxa in the planitibia group based on nucleotide sequences from two mitochondrial (16S and COII) and four nuclear (Adh, Gpdh, Yp1, and Yp2) loci, accounting for over 4‚{\"A}†kb of sequence per taxon. We use these data to estimate major divergence times within this group. Our results suggest that the basal diversification within this group, calculated at 6.1‚{\"A}†$\pm$‚{\"A}†0.47 MY, predates the oldest high island of Kauai. The older diversifications in this group took place on Kauai, with subsequent colonization and speciation events occurring as new islands became available to Drosophila. Understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of this important group will place the existing population genetic work in a macroevolutionary context and stimulate additional work, particularly on those taxa endemic to the Maui Nui complex of islands.},

It is likely that such covariations are produced by similar selective pressures on independent larval and adult characters rather than by genetic or functional linkage. We briefly discuss why larval/adult covariations might constitute an important evolutionary phenomenon in species for which more than one developmental stage potentially has access to multiple environmental conditions.},

@article{Bossuyt:2006be,
	abstract = {Ranidae is a large anuran group with a nearly cosmopolitan distribution. We investigated the phylogenetic relationships and early biogeographic history of ranid frogs, using 104 representatives of all subfamilies and families, sampled from throughout their distribution. Analyses of similar to 1570 bp of nuclear gene fragments (Rag-1, rhod, Tyr) and similar to 2100 bp of the mitochondrial genome (12S rRNA, tRNA(VAL), 16S rRNA) indicate that the monophyly of several taxa can be rejected with high confidence. Our tree is characterized by a clear historical association of each major clade with one Gondwanan plate. This prevalence of continent-scale endemism suggests that plate tectonics has played a major role in the distribution of ranid frogs. We performed dispersal-vicariance analyses, as well as analyses constrained by paleogeographic data, to estimate ancestral distributions during early ranid diversification. Additionally, we used molecular clock analyses to evaluate whether these scenarios fit the temporal framework of continental breakup. Our analyses suggest that a scenario in which the ancestors of several clades (Rhacophorinae, Dicroglossinae, Raninae) reached Eurasia via the Indian subcontinent, and the ancestor of Ceratobatrachinae entered via the Australia-New Guinea plate, best fits the paleogeographic models and requires the fewest number of dispersal/vicariance events. However, several alternatives, in which part of the ranid fauna colonized Laurasia from Africa, are not significantly worse. Most importantly, all hypotheses make clear predictions as to where to expect key fossils and where to sample other living ranids, and thus constitute a strong basis for further research.

	abstract = {We review recent trends in phylogeography and phylogenetics and argue that these two fields stand to be reunited by the common yardstick provided by sequence and SNP data and by new multilocus methods for phylogenetic analysis. Whereas the modern incarnation of both fields was spawned by PCR approaches applied to mitochondrial DNA in the late 1980s, the two fields diverged during the 1990s largely due to the adoption by phylogeographers of microsatellites, in contrast to the adoption of nuclear sequence data by phylogeneticists. Sequence-based markers possess a number of advantages over microsatellites, even on the recent time scales that are the purview of phylogeography. Using examples primarily from vertebrates, we trace the maturation of nuclear gene phylogeography and phylogenetics and suggest that the abundant instances of gene tree heterogeneity beckon a new generation of phylogenetic methods that focus on estimating species trees as distinct from gene trees. Whole genomes provide a powerful common yardstick on which both phylogeography and phylogenetics can assume their proper place as ends of a continuum.},

	abstract = {Biologists employ phylogenetic comparative methods to study adaptive evolution. However, none of the popular methods model selection directly. We explain and develop a method based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, first proposed by Hansen. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models incorporate both selection and drift and are thus qualitatively different from, and more general than, pure drift models based on Brownian motion. Most importantly, OU models possess selective optima that formalize the notion of adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for one quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our approach allows us to translate hypotheses regarding adaptation in different selective regimes into explicit models, to test the models against data using maximum-likelihood-based model selection techniques, and to infer details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the method using two worked examples. Relative to existing approaches, the direct modeling approach we demonstrate allows one to explore more detailed hypotheses and to utilize more of the information content of comparative data sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a model selection framework to simultaneously compare a variety of hypotheses advances our ability to assess alternative evolutionary explanations.},

	abstract = {Sexual dimorphism is widespread and substantial throughout the animal world(1,2). It is surprising, then, that such a pervasive source of biological diversity has not been integrated into studies of adaptive radiation, despite extensive and growing attention to both phenomena(1,3-7). Rather, most studies of adaptive radiation either group individuals without regard to sex or focus solely on one sex. Here we show that sexual differences contribute substantially to the ecomorphological diversity produced by the adaptive radiations of West Indian Anolis lizards: within anole species, males and females occupy mostly non-overlapping parts of morphological space; the overall extent of sexual variation is large relative to interspecific variation; and the degree of variation depends on ecological type. Thus, when sexual dimorphism in ecologically relevant traits is substantial, ignoring its contribution may significantly underestimate the adaptive component of evolutionary radiation. Conversely, if sexual dimorphism and interspecific divergence are alternative means of ecological diversification, then the degree of sexual dimorphism may be negatively related to the extent of adaptive radiation.},

Extrinsic factors have previously been linked to variation in the rate of morphological change among clades. Here, we ask whether species co-occurrence is positively correlated with the rate of change in several ecologically relevant morphological characters using the North American freshwater fish clade Percina (Teleostei: Etheostomatinae). We constructed a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree of Percina from mtDNA sequence data, gathered data on eight morphological characters from 37 species, used a principal components analysis to identify the primary axes of morphological variation, and analyzed 16,094 collection records to estimate species co-occurrence. We then calculated standardized independent contrasts (SIC) of the morphological traits (rate of change) at each node, estimated ancestral species co-occurrence, and quantified the correlation between species co-occurrence and rate of morphological change. We find that morphology changes more quickly when co-occurrence is greater in Percina. Our results provide strong evidence that co-occurrence among close relatives is linked to the morphological diversification of this clade.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships among representative species of the subfamily Raninae were investigated using approximately 2000 base pairs of DNA sequences from two mitochondrial (12S rRNA, 16S rRNA) and two nuclear (tyrosinase, rhodopsin) genes. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using maximum parsimony, Bayesian, and maximum likelihood analyses. Comparison between the nuclear and mitochondrial findings suggested that our final combined data has higher resolving power than the separate data sets. The tribes Stauroini and Ranini formed a sistergroup relationship, and within Ranini, ten major clades were consistently resolved among all analyses based on the final combined data, although the phylogenetic relationships among the ten clades were not well resolved. Our result refuted several previous taxonomic divisions: the genus Pseudoamolops was invalid, and the monophyly of the genera Amolops and Rana were not supported. We suggest elevating Raninae to familial status, and recognizing within the family, at least twelve genera including Staurois, Meristogenys, Clinotarsus, Amolops, Hylarana, Babina, Odorrana, Pseudorana, Rana, Lithobates, Glandirana, and Pelophylax. A broader sampling of species and data from more molecular markers are needed to confidently resolve the phylogenetic relationships among Ranidae. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Clark:2008,
	abstract = {Island systems have long been useful models for understanding lineage diversification in a geographic context, especially pertaining to the importance of dispersal in the origin of new clades. Here we use a well-resolved phylogeny of the flowering plant genus Cyrtandra (Gesneriaceae) from the Pacific Islands to compare four methods of inferring ancestral geographic ranges in islands: two developed for character-state reconstruction that allow only single-island ranges and do not explicitly associate speciation with range evolution (Fitch parsimony [FP; parsimony-based] and stochastic mapping [SM; likelihood-based]) and two methods developed specifically for ancestral range reconstruction, in which widespread ranges (spanning islands) are integral to inferences about speciation scenarios (dispersal-vicariance analysis [DIVA; parsimony-based] and dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis [DEC; likelihood-based]). The methods yield conflicting results, which we interpret in light of their respective assumptions. FP exhibits the least power to unequivocally reconstruct ranges, likely due to a combination of having flat (uninformative) transition costs and not using branch length information. SM reconstructions generally agree with a prior hypothesis about dispersal-driven speciation across the Pacific, despite the conceptual mismatch between its character-based model and this mode of range evolution. In contrast with narrow extant ranges for species of Cyrtandra, DIVA reconstructs broad ancestral ranges at many nodes. DIVA results also conflict with geological information on island ages; we attribute these conflicts to the parsimony criterion not considering branch lengths or time, as well as vicariance being the sole means of divergence for widespread ancestors. DEC analyses incorporated geological information on island ages and allowed prior hypotheses about range size and dispersal rates to be evaluated in a likelihood framework and gave more nuanced inferences about range evolution and the geography of speciation than other methods tested. However, ancestral ranges at several nodes could not be conclusively resolved, due possibly to uncertainty in the phylogeny or the relative complexity of the underlying model. Of the methods tested, SM and DEC both converge on plausible hypotheses for area range histories in Cyrtandra, due in part to the consideration of branch lengths and/or timing of events. We suggest that DEC model-based methods for ancestral range inference could be improved by adopting a Bayesian SM approach, in which stochastic sampling of complete geographic histories could be integrated over alternative phylogenetic topologies. Likelihood-based estimates of ancestral ranges for Cyrtandra suggest a major dispersal route into the Pacific through the islands of Fiji and Samoa, motivating future biogeographic investigation of this poorly known region.},

	abstract = {The elasmobranch fish are an ancient, evolutionarily successful, but under-researched vertebrate group, particularly in regard to their recent evolutionary history. Their lineage has survived four mass extinction events and most present day taxa are thought to be derived from Mesozoic forms. Here we present a molecular phylogenetic analysis of the family Orectolobidae that provides evidence for recent events of diversification in this shark group. Species interrelationships in Orectolobidae were reconstructed based on four mitochondrial and nuclear genes. In line with previous morphological work, our results do not support current taxonomic arrangements in Orectolobidae and indicate that a taxonomic revision of the family is warranted. We propose that the onset of diversification of orectolobid sharks is of Miocene age and occurred within the Indo-Australian region. Surprisingly, we also find evidence for a recent (similar to last 2 million years) and rapid radiation of wobbegong sharks. Allopatric speciation followed by range expansion seems like the general most likely explanation to account for wobbegong relationships and distributions. We suggest that the evolution of this shark group was mostly influenced by two temporal scenarios of diversification. The oldest relates to major geological changes in the Indo-West Pacific associated with the Miocene collision of the Indo-Australian and Eurasian plates. The most recent scenario was influenced by changes in oceanography and the emergence of biogeographic barriers related to Pleistocene glacial cycles in Australian waters.

	abstract = {Ecological character displacement, mostly seen as increased differences of size in sympatry between closely-related or similar species, is a focal hypothesis assuming that species too similar to one another could not coexist without diverging, owing to interspecific competition. Thus, ecological character displacement and community-wide character displacement (overdispersion in size of potential competitors within ecological guilds) were at the heart of the debate regarding the role of competition in structuring ecological communities. The debate has focused on the evidence presented in earlier studies and generated a new generation of rigorous, critical studies of communities. Character displacement research in the past two decades provides sound statistical support for the hypothesis in a wide variety of taxa, albeit with a phylogenetically skewed representation. A growing number of studies are strongly based in functional morphology, and some also demonstrate actual morphologically related resource partitioning. Phylogenetic models and experimental work have added to the scope and depth of earlier research, as have theoretical studies. However, many challenging ecological and evolutionary issues, regarding both selective forces (at the inter- and intraspecific level) and resultant patterns, remain to be addressed. Ecological character displacement and community-wide character displacement are here to stay as the focus of much exciting research.},

In this paper, we derive a method for computing the distribution of gene tree topologies given a bifurcating species tree for trees with an arbitrary number of taxa in the case that there is one gene sampled per species. Applications for gene tree distributions include determining exact probabilities of topological equivalence between gene trees and species trees and inferring species trees from multiple datasets. In addition, we examine the shapes of gene tree distributions and their sensitivity to changes in branch lengths, species tree shape, and tree size. The method for computing gene tree distributions is implemented in the computer program COAL.},

	abstract = {Because of the stochastic way in which lineages sort during speciation, gene trees may differ in topology from each other and from species trees. Surprisingly, assuming that genetic lineages follow a coalescent model of within-species evolution, we find that for any species tree topology with five or more species, there exist branch lengths for which gene tree discordance is so common that the most likely gene tree topology to evolve along the branches of a species tree differs from the species phylogeny. This counterintuitive result implies that in combining data on multiple loci, the straightforward procedure of using the most frequently observed gene tree topology as an estimate of the species tree topology can be asymptotically guaranteed to produce an incorrect estimate. We conclude with suggestions that can aid in overcoming this new obstacle to accurate genomic inference of species phylogenies.},

@article{DeQueiroz:1995,
	abstract = {There has been much discussion in the recent systematic literature over whether different data sets bearing on phylogenetic relationships should be analyzed separately or combined and analyzed simultaneously. We review arguments in favor of each of these views. Assuming that the goal is to uncover the true phylogeny of the entities in question, arguments for combining data based on the notions that one should use the ``total evidence'' available, or that the combined analysis gives the tree with the greatest descriptive and explanatory power, are not compelling. However, combining data sets can enhance detection of real phylogenetic groups. On the other hand, if there is heterogeneity among data sets with respect to some property that affects phylogeny estimation, then combining the data can give misleading results. Thus, there are reasonable arguments on both sides of the debate.

We present a conceptual framework based on the reasons that different data sets may give conflicting estimates of phylogeny. The framework illustrates the point that the precise nature of the difference among data sets is critical in the choice of a method of analysis. In particular, very different approaches are necessary to deal with data sets that differ in processes of character change compared to ones that differ in branching histories. We highlight several recently developed methods designed to deal with these different situations. All of these methods avoid the loss of information that is likely to be associated with summarizing data sets as trees in an intermediate step (an advantage of typical combined analyses), while taking into account heterogeneity among data sets (an advantage of separate analyses). We suggest that the recognition and further development of such methods will help depolarize the debate over combined and separate analysis.},

@article{Dornburg:2008,
	abstract = {Although substantial uncertainty typically surrounds the choice of the best model in most phylogenetic analyses, little is known about how accommodating this uncertainty affects phylogenetic inference. Here we explore the influence of Bayesian model averaging on the phylogenetic inference of the triggerfishes (Family: Balistidae), a charismatic group of reef fishes. We focus on clade support as this area has received little attention and is typically one of the most important outcomes of phylogenetic studies. We present a novel phylogenetic hypothesis for the family Balistidae based on an analysis of two mitochondrial (12S, 16S) and three nuclear genes (TMO-4C4, Rhodopsin, RAG1) sampled from 26 ingroup species. Despite the presence of substantial model uncertainty in almost all partitions of our data, we found model-averaged topologies and clade posteriors to be nearly identical to those conditioned on a single model. Furthermore, statistical comparison of clade posteriors using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed no significant differences. Our results suggest that although current model-selection approaches are likely to lead to overparameterization of the substitution model, the consequences of conditioning on this overparameterized model are likely to be mild. Our phylogenetic results strongly support the monophyly of the triggerfishes but suggest that the genera Balistoides and Pseudobalistes are polyphyletic. Divergence time estimation supports a Miocene origin of the crown group. Despite the presence of several young species-rich subclades, statistical analysis of temporal diversification patterns reveals no significant increase in the rate of cladogenesis across geologic time intervals.},

	abstract = {The vast majority of phylogenetic models focus on resolution of gene trees, despite the fact that phylogenies of species in which gene trees are embedded are of primary interest. We analyze a Bayesian model for estimating species trees that accounts for the stochastic variation expected for gene trees from multiple unlinked loci sampled from a single species history after a coalescent process. Application of the model to a 106-gene data set from yeast shows that the set of gene trees recovered by statistically acknowledging the shared but unknown species tree from which gene trees are sampled is much reduced compared with treating the history of each locus independently of an overarching species tree. The analysis also yields a concentrated posterior distribution of the yeast species tree whose mode is congruent with the concatenated gene tree but can do so with less than half the loci required by the concatenation method. Using simulations, we show that, with large numbers of loci, highly resolved species trees can be estimated under conditions in which concatenation of sequence data will positively mislead phylogeny, and when the proportion of gene trees matching the species tree is <10\%. However, when gene tree/species tree congruence is high, species trees can be resolved with just two or three loci. These results make accessible an alternative paradigm for combining data in phylogenomics that focuses attention on the singularity of species histories and away from the idiosyncrasies and multiplicities of individual gene histories.},

@article{Faivovich:2005hx,
	abstract = {Hylidae is a large family of American, Australopapuan, and temperate Eurasian treefrogs of approximately 870 known species, divided among four subfamilies. Although some groups of Hylidae have been addressed phylogenetically, a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis has never been presented.

The first goal of this paper is to review the current state of hylid systematics. We focus on the very large subfamily Hylinae (590 species), evaluate the monophyly of named taxa, and examine the evidential basis of the existing taxonomy. The second objective is to perform a phylogenetic analysis using mostly DNA sequence data in order to (1) test the monophyly of the Hylidae; (2) determine its constituent taxa, with special attention to the genera and species groups which form the subfamily Hylinae, and c) propose a new, monophyletic taxonomy consistent with the hypothesized relationships.

We present a phylogenetic analysis of hylid frogs based on 276 terminals, including 228 hylids and 48 outgroup taxa. Included are exemplars of all but I of the 41 genera of Hylidae (of all four nominal subfamilies) and 39 of the 41 currently recognized species groups of the species-rich genus Hyla. The included taxa allowed us to test the monophyly of 24 of the 35 nonmonotypic genera and 25 species groups of Hyla. The phylogenetic analysis includes approximately 5100 base pairs from four mitochondrial (12S, tRNA valine, 16S, and cytochrome b) and five nuclear genes (rhodopsin, tyrosinase, RAG-1, seventh in absentia, and 28S), and a small data set from foot musculature.

Concurring with previous studies, the present analysis indicates that Hemiphractinae are not related to the other three hylid subfamilies. It is therefore removed from the family and tentatively considered a subfamily of the paraphyletic Leptodactylidae. Hylidae is now restricted to Hylinae, Pelodryadinae, and Phyllomedusinae. Our results support a sister-group relationship between Pelodryadinae and Phyllomedusinae, which together form the sister taxon of Hylinae. Agolychnis, Phyllomedusa, Litoria, Hyla, Osteocephalus, Phrynohyas, Ptychohyla, Scinax, Smilisca, and Trachycephalus are not monophyletic. Within Hyla, the H. albomarginata, H. albopunctata, H. arborea, H. boans, H. cinerea, H. eximia, H. geographica, H. granosa, H. microcephala, H. miotympanum, H. tuberculosa, and H. versicolor groups are also demonstrably nonmonophyletic. Hylinae is composed of four major clades. The first of these includes the Andean stream-breeding Hyla, Aplastodiscus, all Gladiator Frogs, and a Tepuian clade. The second clade is composed of the 30-chromosome Hyla, Lysapsus, Pseudis, Scarthyla, Scinax (including the H. uruguaya group), Sphaenorhynchus, and Xenohyla. The third major clade is composed of Nyctimantis, Phrynohyas, Phyllodytes, and all South American/ West Indian casque-headed frogs: Aparasphenodon, Argenteohyla, Corythomantis, Osteocephalus, Osteopilus, Tepuihyla, and Trachycephalus. The fourth major clade is composed of most of the Middle American/Holarctic species groups of Hyla and the genera Acris, Anotheca, Duellmanohyla, Plectrohyla, Pseudacris, Ptychohyla, Ptemohyla, Smilisca, and Triprion. A new monophyletic taxonomy mirroring these results is presented where Hylinae is divided into four tribes. Of the species currently in ``Hyla'', 297 of the 353 species are placed in 15 genera; of these, 4 are currently recognized, 4 are resurrected names, and 7 are new. Hyla is restricted to H. femoralis and the H. arborea, H. cinerea, H. eximia, and H. versicolor groups, whose contents are redefined. Phrynohyas is placed in the synonymy of Trachycephalus, and Pternohyla is placed in the synonymy of Smilisca. The genus Dendropsophus is resurrected to include all former species of Hyla known or suspected to have 30 chromosomes. Exerodonta is resurrected to include the former Hyla sumichrasti group and some members of the former H. miorympanum group. Hyloscirtus is resurrected for the former Hyla armata, H. bogotensis, and H. larinopygion groups. Hypsiboas is resurrected to include several species groups-many of them redefined here-of Gladiator Frogs. The former Hyla albofrenata and H. albosignata complexes of the H. albomarginata group are included in Aplastodiscus.

New generic names are erected for (1) Agalychnis calcarifer and A. craspedopus; (2) Osteocephalus langsdorffii; the (3) Hyla aromatica, (4) H. bromeliacia, (5) H. godmani, (6) H. mixomaculata, (7) H. taeniopus, (8) and H. tuberculosa groups; (9) the clade composed of the H. pictipes and H. pseudopuma groups; and (10) a clade composed of the H. circumdata, H. claresignata, H. martinsi, and H. pseudopseudis groups.},

A new taxonomy of living amphibians is proposed to correct the deficiencies of the old one. This new taxonomy is based on the largest phylogenetic analysis of living Amphibia so far accomplished. We combined the comparative anatomical character evidence of Haas (2003) with DNA sequences from the mitochondrial transcription unit HI (12S and 16S ribosomal RNA and tRNA(Valine) genes, 2,400 bp of mitochondrial sequences) and the nuclear genes histone H3, rhodopsin, tyrosinase, and seven in absentia, and the large ribosomal subunit 28S (approximate to 2,300 bp of nuclear sequences; ca. 1.8 million base pairs; x ($) over bar = 3.7 kb/terminal). The dataset includes 532 terminals sampled from 522 species representative of the global diversity of amphibians as well as seven of the closest living relatives of amphibians for outgroup comparisons.},

	abstract = {The isolation of the Hawaiian archipelago has resulted in a fauna that shows high levels of endemism. I examined the role of lifestyle, as inferred from web-building versus non-web-building behavior, in dictating the rate of differentiation and species formation within a lineage of spiders in the genus Tetragnatha from the Hawaiian Islands. This genus comprises a group of morphologically, ecologically and behaviorally diverse taxa. Included in the radiation is a 'spiny-leg' clade which never builds webs and is relatively loosely associated with a specific habitat, and a large group of web-building species which are generally more tightly associated with a given substrate and habitat. Sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase DNA provided relative estimates of the age of a clade. Both linear and logarithmic models were used to estimate rates of speciation and the relative time required for speciation for each clade. The results showed that several small clades of web-building species have a greater rate of speciation as compared to the 'spiny-leg' clade. One explanation is that the web-building species may be capable of differentiation between more closely contiguous habitats, which would be consistent with the hypothesis that ecological differentiation promotes diversification and species formation. Possible alternative explanations for the results include differences in rates of molecular evolution, for example as a consequence of differences in metabolic activity.},

	abstract = {The known diversity of dart-poison frog species has grown from 70 in the 1960s to 247 at present, with no sign that the discovery of new species will wane in the foreseeable future. Although this growth in knowledge of the diversity of this group has been accompanied by detailed investigations of many aspects of the biology of dendrobatids, their phylogenetic relationships remain poorly understood. This study was designed to test hypotheses of dendrobatid diversification by combining new and prior genotypic and phenotypic evidence in a total evidence analysis. DNA sequences were sampled for five mitochondrial and six nuclear loci (approximately 6,100 base pairs [bp]; (x) over bar =3,740 bp per terminal; total dataset composed of approximately 1.55 million bp), and 174 phenotypic characters were scored from adult and larval morphology, alkaloid profiles, and behavior. These data were combined with relevant published DNA sequences. Ingroup sampling targeted several previously unsampled species, including Aromobates nocturnus, which was hypothesized previously to be the sister of all other dendrobatids. Undescribed and problematic species were sampled from multiple localities when possible. The final dataset consisted of 414 terminals: 367 ingroup terminals of 156 species and 47 outgroup terminals of 46 species.

Direct optimization parsimony analysis of the equally weighted evidence resulted in 25,872 optimal trees. Forty nodes collapse in the strict consensus, with all conflict restricted to conspecific terminals. Dendrobatids were recovered as monophyletic, and their sister group consisted of Crossodactylus, Hylodes, and Megaelosia, recognized herein as Hylodidae. Among outgroup taxa, Centrolenidae was found to be the sister group of all athesphatanurans except Hylidae, Leptodactyidae was polyphyletic, Thoropa was nested within Cycloramphidae, and Ceratophryinae was paraphyletic with respect to Telmatobiinae. Among dendrobatids, the monophyly and content of Mannophryne and Phyllobates were corroborated. Aromobates nocturnus and Colostethus saltuensis were found to be nested within Nephelobates, and Minyobates was paraphyletic and nested within Dendrobates. Colostethus was shown to be rampantly nonmonophyletic, with most species falling into two unrelated cis- and trans-Andean clades. A morphologically and behaviorally diverse clade of median lingual process-possessing species was discovered.

In light of these findings and the growth in knowledge of the diversity of this large clade over the past 40 years, we propose a new, monophyletic taxonomy for dendrobatids, recognizing the inclusive clade as a superfamily (Dendrobatoidea) composed of two families (one of which is new), six subfamilies (three new), and 16 genera (four new). Although poisonous frogs did not form a monophyletic group, the three poisonous lineages are all confined to the revised family Dendrobatidae, in keeping with the traditional application of this name. We also propose changes to achieve a monophyletic higher-level taxonomy for the athesphatanuran outgroup taxa.

Analysis of character evolution revealed multiple origins of phytotelm-breeding, parental provisioning of nutritive oocytes for larval consumption (larval oophagy), and endotrophy. Available evidence indicates that transport of tadpoles on the dorsum of parent nurse frogs - a dendrobatid synapomorphy - is carried out primitively by male nurse frogs, with three independent origins of female transport and five independent origins of biparental transport. Reproductive amplexus is optimally explained as having been lost in the most recent common ancestor of Dendrobatoidea, with cephalic amplexus arising independently three times.},

@article{Guisan:2000,
	abstract = {
With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone.},

	abstract = {Comparative studies tend to differ from optimality and functionality studies in how they treat adaptation. While the comparative approach focuses on the origin and change of traits, optimality studies assume that adaptations are maintained at an optimum by stabilizing selection. This paper presents a model of adaptive evolution on a macroevolutionary time scale that includes the maintenance of traits at adaptive optima by stabilizing selection as the dominant evolutionary force. Interspecific variation is treated as variation in the position of adaptive optima. The model illustrates how phylogenetic constraints nor only lead to correlations between phylogenetically related species, but also to imperfect adaptations. From this model, a statistical comparative method is derived that can be used to estimate the effect of a selective factor on adaptive optima in a way that would be consistent with an optimality study of adaptation to this factor. The method is illustrated with an analysis of dental evolution in fossil horses. The use of comparative methods to study evolutionary trends is also discussed.},

Multiple sequence alignment remains one of the most powerful tools for assessing sequence relateness and the identification of structurally and functionally important protein regions. In this work, two new techniques are introduced to increase the sensitivity of dynamic programming and to enable checks for alignment consistency: Profile-preprocessed and secondary structure-induced alignments. Both strategies are based upon the hierarchical dynamic programming technique and can be applied separately or used in combination. Alignments resulting from the strategies are shown in comparison with the multiple alignment methods CLUSTALX and MULTAL for distant sequence sets of the flavoxin and cupredoxin protein families.},

	abstract = {The molecular clock has proved to be extremely valuable in placing timescales on evolutionary events that would otherwise be difficult to date. However, debate has arisen about the considerable disparities between molecular and palaeontological or archaeological dates, and about the remarkably high mutation rates inferred in pedigree studies. We argue that these debates can be largely resolved by reference to the 'time dependency of molecular rates', a recent hypothesis positing that short-term mutation rates and long-term substitution rates are related by a monotonic decline from the former to the latter. Accordingly, the extrapolation of rates across different timescales will result in invalid date estimates. We examine the impact of this hypothesis with respect to various fields, including human evolution, animal domestication and conservation genetics. We conclude that many studies involving recent divergence events will need to be reconsidered.},

@article{Hoegg:2004,
	abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships among major clades of anuran amphibians were studied using partial sequences of three nuclear protein coding genes, Rag-1, Rag-2, and rhodopsin in 26 frog species from 18 families. The concatenated nuclear data set comprised 2,616 nucleotides and was complemented by sequences of the mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA genes for analyses of evolutionary rates. Separate and combined analyses of the nuclear markers supported the monophyly of modem frogs (Neobatrachia), whereas they did not provide support for the monophyly of archaic frog lineages (Archaeobatrachia), contrary to previous studies based on mitochondrial data. The Neobatrachia contain two well supported clades that correspond to the subfamilies Ranoidea (Hyperoliidae, Mantellidae, Microhylidae, Ranidae, and Rhacophoridae) and Hyloidea (Bufonidae, Hylidae, Leptodactylidae, and Pseudidae). Two other families (Heleophrynidae and Sooglossidae) occupied basal positions and probably represent ancient relicts within the Neobatrachia, which had been less clearly indicated by previous mitochondrial analyses. Branch lengths of archaeobatrachians were consistently shorter in all separate analyses, and nonparametric rate smoothing indicated accelerated substitution rates in neobatrachians. However, relative rate tests confirmed this tendency only for mitochondrial genes. In contrast, nuclear gene sequences from our study and from an additional GenBank survey showed no clear phylogenetic trends in terms of differences in rates of molecular evolution. Maximum likelihood trees based on Rag-1 and using only one neobatrachian and one archaeobatrachian sequence, respectively, even had longer archaeobatrachian branches averaged over all pairwise comparisons. More data are necessary to understand the significance of a possibly general assignation of short branches to basal and species-poor taxa by tree-reconstruction algorithms.},

	abstract = {Eastern North America is the location of the world's most species-rich temperate freshwater fish fauna. Hypotheses regarding the geographic and temporal scale of teleost diversification in this region have not been broadly investigated using absolute divergence time estimates among the constituent lineages. This study used time-calibrated molecular phylogenies estimated from mitochondrial and nuclear genes to investigate the temporal and geographic signatures of diversification within barcheek darters, a clade of allopatrically distributed species endemic to the Eastern Highlands. Results from divergence time estimates using an uncorrelated lognormal model suggest that the barcheek darters are an ancient group with a crown node estimate of 16.3 mya, 95% highest posterior density (HPD): [12.4, 20.5], and the clade is characterized by substantial intraspecific divergence times within several species. In particular, the Caney Fork endemic Etheostoma basilare comprises five strongly supported and deeply divergent clades with a most recent common ancestor estimated at 8.0 mya, 95% HPD: [5.6, 10.7]. These results are concordant with the hypothesis that geologically stable areas of eastern North America have facilitated both the generation and preservation of lineages across a substantial breadth of evolutionary time, and that allopatric speciation in darters has occurred at much smaller spatial scales than previously realized.},

	abstract = {Molecular data are commonly used to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of organisms. However, evolutionary reconstructions from different molecular data sets sometimes conflict. It is generally unknown whether these different estimates of history result from random variation in the processes of nucleotide substitution or from fundamentally different evolutionary mehanisms underlying the histories of the genes analyzed. We describe a novel likelihood ratio test that compares different topologies (each estimated from a different data partition for the same taxa) to determine if they are significantly different. The results of this test indicate that different genes provide significantly different phylogenies for amniotes, supporting earlier suggestions based on less direct tests. These results suggest that some molecular data can give misleading information about evolutionary history.},

These methods assume a specific tree and set of branch lengths when estimating the ancestral character state. Inferences of the ancestral states, then, are conditioned on the tree and branch lengths being true. We develop a hierarchical Bayes method for inferring the ancestral states on a tree. The method integrates over uncertainty in the tree, branch lengths, and substitution model parameters by using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We compare the hierarchical Bayes inferences of ancestral states with inferences of ancestral states made under the assumption that a specific tree is correct. We find that the methods are correlated, but that accommodating uncertainty in parameters of the phylogenetic model can make inferences of ancestral states even more uncertain than they would be in an empirical Bayes analysis.},

Here, we introduce a Bayesian method for inferring the root of a phylogenetic tree by using one of several criteria: the outgroup, molecular clock, and nonreversible model of DNA substitution. We perform simulation analyses to examine the relative ability of these three criteria to correctly identify the root of the tree. The outgroup and molecular clock criteria were best able to identify the root of the tree, whereas the nonreversible model was able to identify the root only when the substitution process was highly nonreversible. We also examined the performance of the criteria for a tree of four species for which the topology and root position are well supported. Results of the analyses of these data are consistent with the simulation results.},

	abstract = {Many questions in evolutionary biology are best addressed by comparing traits in different species. Often such studies involve mapping characters on phylogenetic trees. Mapping characters on trees allows the nature, number, and timing of the transformations to be identified. The parsimony method is the only method available for mapping morphological characters on phylogenies. Although the parsimony method often makes reasonable reconstructions of the history of a character, it has a number of limitations. These limitations include the inability to consider more than a single change along a branch on a tree and the uncoupling of evolutionary time from amount of character change. We extended a method described by Nielsen (2002, Syst. Biol. 51:729-739) to the mapping of morphological characters under continuous-time Markov models and demonstrate here the utility of the method for mapping characters on trees and for identifying character correlation.},

	abstract = {A common problem in molecular phylogenetics is choosing a model of DNA substitution that does a good job of explaining the DNA sequence alignment without introducing superfluous parameters. A number of methods have been used to choose among a small set of candidate substitution models, such as the likelihood ratio test, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), tire Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Bayes factors. Current implementations of any of these criteria suffer from the limitation that only a small set of models are examined, or that the test does not allow easy comparison of non-nested models. In this article, we expand the pool of candidate substitution models to include all possible time-reversible models. This set includes seven models that have already been described. We show how Bayes factors can be calculated for these models using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo, and apply the method to 16 DNA sequence alignments. For each data set, we compare the model with the best Bayes factor to the best models chosen using AIC and BIC. We find that the best model under any of these criteria is not necessarily the most complicated one; models with an intermediate number of substitution types typically do best. Moreover, almost all of the models that are chosen as best do not constrain a transition rate to be the same as a transversion rate, suggesting that it is the transition/transversion rate bias that plays the largest role in determining which models are selected.

Our results confirm two predictions; clinging ability is tightly correlated with pad area, even when the effects of body size are removed, and the lizards examined are approximately functionally similar in their clinging capabilities. Nevertheless, despite the tight correlation between pad area and clinging ability, pad area scales with body mass by a lower slope than clinging ability. Overall, these results indicate that although pad area is a strong determinant of clinging ability, other Factors enable these lizards to maintain functional similarity.},

	abstract = {Microhylidae account for the majority of frog species on New Guinea and have evolved an extraordinarily wide range of ecological, behavioural, and morphological traits. Several species are known for their unique paternal care behaviour, which includes guarding of clutches in some and additional froglet transport in other species. We sampled 48 out of 215 New Guinean microhylid species and all but two (Mantophryne and Pherohapsis) of 18 New Guinean genera and analysed a concatenated data set of partial sequences of the mitochondrial genes 12S and 16S, which comprises 1220 aligned nucleotide positions, in order to infer the phylogenetic relationships within this diverse group of frogs. The trees do provide resolution at shallow, but not at deep branches. Monophyly is rejected for the genera Callulops, Liophryne, Austrochaperina, Copiula, and Cophixalus as currently recognized. Six clades are well supported: (1) Hylophorbus and Callulops cf. robustus, (2) its sister taxon comprising Xenorhina, Asterophrys turpicola, and Callulops except for C cf robustus, (3) Liophryne rhododactyla, L. dentata, Oxydactyla crassa, and Sphenophryne cornuta, (4) Copiula and Austrochaperina, (5) Barygenys exsul, Cophixalus spp., and Oreophryne, (6) Cophixalus sphagnicola, Albericus laurini, and Choerophryne. The phylogenies provide evidence for the parallel evolution of parental care modes, life styles, and morphological traits that have thus far been emphasized in recent classifications.

	abstract = {As a key factor in endemic and epidemic dynamics, the geographical distribution of viruses has been frequently interpreted in the light of their genetic histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.},

@article{Liu:2007,
	abstract = {The desire to infer the evolutionary history of a group of species should be more viable now that a considerable amount of multilocus molecular data is available. However, the current molecular phylogenetic paradigm still reconstructs gene trees to represent the species tree. Further, commonly used methods of combining data, such as the concatenation method, are known to be inconsistent in some circumstances. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the phylogeny of a group of species using multiple estimated gene tree distributions, such as those that arise in a Bayesian analysis of DNA sequence data. Our model employs substitution models used in traditional phylogenetics but also uses coalescent theory to explain genealogical signals from species trees to gene trees and from gene trees to sequence data, thereby forming a complete stochastic model to estimate gene trees, species trees, ancestral population sizes, and species divergence times simultaneously. Our model is founded on the assumption that gene trees, even of unlinked loci, are correlated due to being derived from a single species tree and therefore should be estimated jointly. We apply the method to two multilocus data sets of DNA sequences. The estimates of the species tree topology and divergence times appear to be robust to the prior of the population size, whereas the estimates of effective population sizes are sensitive to the prior used in the analysis. These analyses also suggest that the model is superior to the concatenation method in fitting these data sets and thus provides a more realistic assessment of the variability in the distribution of the species tree that may have produced the molecular information at hand. Future improvements of our model and algorithm should include consideration of other factors that can cause discordance of gene trees and species trees, such as horizontal transfer or gene duplication.},

@article{Liu:2008,
	abstract = {Several techniques, such as concatenation and consensus methods, are available for combining data from multiple loci to produce a single statement of phylogenetic relationships. However, when multiple alleles are sampled from individual species, it becomes more challenging to estimate relationships at the level of species, either because concatenation becomes inappropriate due to conflicts among individual gene trees, or because the species from which multiple alleles have been sampled may not form monophyletic groups in the estimated tree. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to reconstruct species trees from multipleallele, multilocus sequence data, building on a recently proposed method for estimating species trees from single allele multilocus data. A two-step Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is adopted to estimate the posterior distribution of the species tree. The model is applied to estimate the posterior distribution of species trees for two multiple-allele datasets-yeast (Saccharomyces) and birds (Manacus-manakins). The estimates of the species trees using our method are consistent with those inferred from other methods and genetic markers, but in contrast to other species tree methods, it provides credible regions for the species tree. The Bayesian approach described here provides a powerful framework for statistical testing and integration of population genetics and phylogenetics.},

@article{Liu:2009dg,
	abstract = {The estimation of species trees (phylogenies) is one of the most important problems in evolutionary biology, and recently, there has been greater appreciation of the need to estimate species trees directly rather than using gene trees as a surrogate. A Bayesian method constructed under the multispecies coalescent model can consistently estimate species trees but involves intensive computation, which can hinder its application to the phylogenetic analysis of large-scale genomic data. Many summary statistics-based approaches, such as shallowest coalescences (SC) and Global LAteSt Split (GLASS), have been developed to infer species phylogenies for multilocus data sets. In this paper, we propose 2 methods, species tree estimation using average ranks of coalescences (STAR) and species tree estimation using average coalescence times (STEAC), based on the summary statistics of coalescence times. It can be shown that the 2 methods are statistically consistent under the multispecies coalescent model. STAR uses the ranks of coalescences and is thus resistant to variable substitution rates along the branches in gene trees. A simulation study suggests that STAR consistently outperforms STEAC, SC, and GLASS when the substitution rates among lineages are highly variable. Two real genomic data sets were analyzed by the 2 methods and produced species trees that are consistent with previous results.},

	abstract = {We review recent models to estimate phylogenetic trees under the multispecies coalescent. Although the distinction between gene trees and species trees has come to the fore of phylogenetics, only recently have methods been developed that explicitly estimate species trees. Of the several factors that can cause gene tree heterogeneity and discordance with the species tree, deep coalescence due to random genetic drift in branches of the species tree has been modeled most thoroughly. Bayesian approaches to estimating species trees utilizes two likelihood functions, one of which has been widely used in traditional phylogenetics and involves the model of nucleotide substitution, and the second of which is less familiar to phylogeneticists and involves the probability distribution of gene trees given a species tree. Other recent parametric and nonparametric methods for estimating species trees involve parsimony criteria, summary statistics, supertree and consensus methods. Species tree approaches are an appropriate goal for systematics, appear to work well in some cases where concatenation can be misleading, and suggest that sampling many independent loci will be paramount. Such methods can also be challenging to implement because of the complexity of the models and computational time. In addition, further elaboration of the simplest of coalescent models will be required to incorporate commonly known issues such as deviation from the molecular clock, gene flow and other genetic forces.

	abstract = {The phylogenetic relationships of microhylid frogs are poorly understood. The first molecular phylogeny for continental African microhylids is presented, including representatives of all subfamilies, six of the eight genera, and the enigmatic hemisotid Hemisus. Mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA sequence data were analysed using parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian methods. Analyses of the data are consistent with the monophyly of all sampled subfamilies and genera. Hemisus does not nest within either brevicipitines or non-brevicipitines. It is possibly the sister group to brevicipitines, in which case brevicipitines might not be microhylids. Phrynomantis and Hoplophryne potentially group with non-African, non-brevicipitine microhylids, in agreement with recent morphological and molecular data. Within brevicipitines, Breviceps is recovered as the sister group to a clade of Callulina + Spelaeophryne + Probreviceps. The relationships among the genera within this latter clade are unclear, being sensitive to the method of analysis. Optimal trees suggest the Probreviceps macrodactylus subspecies complex might be paraphyletic with respect to P. uluguruensis, corroborating preliminary morphological studies indicating that P. m. rungwensis may be a distinct species. P. m. loveridgei may be paraphyletic with respect to P. m. macrodactylus, though this is not strongly supported. Some biogeographic hypotheses are examined in light of these findings.

	abstract = {Neotropical cichlid fishes comprise approximately 60 genera and at least 600 species, but despite this diversity, their phylogeny is only partially understood, which limits taxonomic, ecological and evolutionary research. We report the largest molecular phylogeny of Neotropical cichlids produced to date, combining data from three mitochondrial and two nuclear markers for 57 named genera and 154 species from South and Central America. Neotropical cichlids (subfamily Cichlinae) were strongly monophyletic and were grouped into two main clades in which the genera Retroculus (Tribe Retroculini) and Cichla (Cichlini) were sister to a monophyletic group containing all other lineages. This group included the tribes Chaetobranchini, Astronotini, Geophagini, Cichlasomatini and Heroini. Topological comparisons with previously published hypotheses indicated that our results are congruent with recent analyses of the tribe Cichlasomatini, but significantly more likely than published hypotheses for Geophagini. Heroini and the entire Cichlinae. Improved resolution and support are attributed to increased taxon sampling and to the addition of taxa never before included in phylogenetic analyses. Geophagini included two major subclades congruent with our own previous findings but more strongly supported: we also found a new and strongly supported sister-group relationship between Guianacara and Mazarunia. Cichlasomatini relationships were similar to recently proposed topologies, but contrastingly, we found a monophyletic Cichlasoma and support for a monophyletic grouping of the Aequidens diadema and A. tetramerus groups. Three basal South American Heroini lineages were recovered: (Hypselecara + Hoplarchus), Pterophyllum, and a grouping we refer to as mesonautines. Three other South American clades, caquetaines, Australoheros and the 'Cichlasoma' festae group, were nested within Central American clades. Most Heroini diversity was divided into two relatively well-supported large groups: the Southern Central American Clade, including clades herein referred to as nandopsines, caquetaines and amphilophines, and the Northern Central American Cade, including astatheroines, tomocichlines and herichthyines. Some of these groups have been previously identified, but often with different taxonomic compositions. Further resolution of Neotropical cichlid relationships, especially within the large amphilophine clade of Heroini, will require additional phylogenetic analysis. Nevertheless, the topology from this study provides a robust phylogenetic framework for studying evolutionary diversification in Neotropical cichlids. Significantly-short branches at the base of Geophagini and Heroini are compatible with early bursts of divergence that are characteristic of adaptive radiations. This pattern suggests diversification of Neotropical cichlid genera occurred rapidly, with subsequent convergent, adaptive ecomorphological diversification among and within South and Central American clades.

	abstract = {Caribbean Anolis lizards are a classic case of adaptive radiation, repeated four times across islands of the Greater Antilles. On each island, very similar patterns of evolutionary divergence have occurred, resulting in the evolution of the same set of ecological specialists-termed ecomorphs-on each island. However, this is only part of the story of the Caribbean anole radiation,;. Indeed, much of the species diversity of Caribbean Anolis occurs within clades of ecomorphs, which contain as many as 14 ecologically-similar species on a single island. We ask to what extent the classic model of ecological interactions as the driving force in adaptive radiation can account for this aspect of anole evolutionary diversity. Our answer is that it can in part, but riot entirely. More generally, the most complete understanding of evolutionary diversification and radiation is achieved by studying multiple hierarchical evolutionary levels from clades to populations.},

	abstract = {Charles Darwin's travels on HMS Beagle taught him that islands are an important source of evidence for evolution. Because many islands are young and have relatively few species, evolutionary adaptation and species proliferation are obvious and easy to study. In addition, the geographical isolation of many islands has allowed evolution to take its own course, free of influence from other areas, resulting in unusual faunas and floras, often unlike those found anywhere else. For these reasons, island research provides valuable insights into speciation and adaptive radiation, and into the relative importance of contingency and determinism in evolutionary diversification.},

	abstract = {It is now well known that incomplete lineage sorting can cause serious difficulties for phylogenetic inference, but little attention has been paid to methods that attempt to overcome these difficulties by explicitly considering the processes that produce them. Here we explore approaches to phylogenetic inference designed to consider retention and sorting of ancestral polymorphism. We examine how the reconstructability of a species (or population) phylogeny is affected by (a) the number of loci used to estimate the phylogeny and (b) the number of individuals sampled per species. Even in difficult cases with considerable incomplete lineage sorting (times between divergences less than 1 Ne generations), we found the reconstructed species trees matched the "true" species trees in at least three out of five partitions, as long as a reasonable number of individuals per species were sampled. We also studied the tradeoff between sampling more loci versus more individuals. Although increasing the number of loci gives more accurate trees for a given sampling effort with deeper species trees (e.g., total depth of 10 Ne generations), sampling more individuals often gives better results than sampling more loci with shallower species trees (e.g., depth = 1 Ne). Taken together, these results demonstrate that gene sequences retain enough signal to achieve an accurate estimate of phylogeny despite widespread incomplete lineage sorting. Continued improvement in our methods to reconstruct phylogeny near the species level will require a shift to a compound model that considers not only nucleotide or character state substitutions, but also the population genetics processes of lineage sorting.},

	abstract = {We examine phylogeographic structure across a wide-ranging microhylid frog (Gastrophryne carolinensis) using both mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear (AFLP) data. Species with similar ecological characteristics such as large range size, low vagility, or existence across known biogeographic barriers, often are comprised of multiple, cryptic lineages. Surprisingly, our analyses of both portions of the genome show very little phylogeographic or population genetic structure. The family Microhylidae is one of the largest families of anurans with over 60 genera and around 400 species distributed across much of the world (Americas, Asia, Africa, and Madagascar), but very few phylogeographic studies have assessed intraspecific genetic diversity across the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Our results suggest that G. carolinensis, one of only three species of microhylid native to the US, has experienced a severe population bottleneck with subsequent range expansion. Comparable molecular data from closely related microhylids, in addition to demographic and ecological analyses, will provide valuable insight into patterns of genetic diversity and the processes driving phylogeographic diversity in these wide-ranging frogs.},

	abstract = {A molecular phylogenetic survey was conducted using mtDNA sequences of 12S and 16S rRNA, and cyt-b genes to examine taxonomic relationships among populations of the Pan-Oriental microhylid, Microhyla ornata, from India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Laos, China, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Archipelago of Japan. Two discrete clades are recognized within this species, one consisting of populations from India and Bangladesh, and the other encompassing the remaining populations. In the latter clade, populations from the Ryukyu Archipelago are clearly split from the rest (populations from Taiwan and the continent) with considerable degrees of genetic differentiations. Each of the three lineages is judged to represent a good species, and the name Microhyla ornata is restricted to the South Asian populations. For the populations from Taiwan and a wide region from China to Southeast Asia, the name Microhyla fissipes should be applied, whereas the Ryukyu populations are most appropriately referred to as Microhyla okinavensis, although further substantial genetic differentiations are recognized among some island group populations within this last species.},

	abstract = {Owing to a general paucity of characters and an apparently high level of homoplasy, the systematics of frogs have remained disputed. A phylogeny based on the single-copy nuclear Rag-1 gene revealed unexpected placements of scaphiophrynine and brevicipitine toads. The former have usually been considered as sister group to all other extant microhylids or are even classified as a separate family. Their basal position among microhylids was weakly indicated in our analysis; but they clearly are part of a strongly supported clade composed of representatives from five other microhylid subfamilies. By contrast, the brevicipitines, a group that hitherto was unanimously considered to belong to the Microhylidae, were highly divergent and placed as a sister group to the arthroleptoid clade. These novel phylogenetic placements are best reflected by a classificatory status of the Scaphiophryninae as a subfamily of the Microhylidae, whereas the brevicipitines may merit recognition as a distinct family. Our findings seem to corroborate a high degree of morphological homoplasy in frogs and suggest that even highly derived morphological states, such as the hydrostatic tongue of microhylids, hemisotids and brevicipitines, may be subject to convergent evolution, parallelism or character reversal.},

Ilia among species in these families were found to be relatively invariate with similar sized species often indistinguishable; thus fossil species diversity is therefore likely to be underestimated in such deposits. Nine-two disarticulated ilia from the highland Nombe rockshelter deposit represent a minimum of six species: two Hylidae and four Microhylidae; most of these ilia were deposited in the late Pleistocene before significant human activity at the site. Problems of drawing conclusions about the Pleistocene frog fauna of the area, especially what the main predator was, from such a small sample and limited understanding of the site taphonomy are discussed.},

	abstract = {We assessed the utility of congruence and multiple data sets to test species relationships and the accuracy of phylogenetic methods. The ongoing controversy about whether to combine data sets for phylogenetic analysis was evaluated against the naturalness of different types of data (as commonly recognized by systematists) and character independence. We defend the recommendation that independent data sets (defined in terms of process partitions; sensu bull et al., 1993, Syst. Biol. 42:384-397) should rarely be combined but should be kept separate for phylogenetic analysis because their independence increases the significance of corroboration. Trees of natural taxa, well supported by many independent lines of evidence, should be used in the same way as the known phylogenies of simulations and of certain laboratory and domesticated groups, i.e., as standards for evaluating the accuracy of different phylogenetic methods. Although compromised by their imperfect reliabilities, such tests using well-supported trees of wild taxa provide important reality checks on the conclusions of the other two approaches by encompassing more of the complexity and diversity of natural systems and their evolutionary processes. In this way, a combination of testing with the well-supported trees of natural groups, with simulations, and with those laboratory and domesticated taxa with known phylogenies is most likely to prove effective in establishing the strengths, weaknesses, and assumptions of different phylogenetic methods.},

@article{Navas:2004,
	abstract = {Amphisbaenians are legless reptiles that differ significantly from other vertebrate lineages. Most species dig underground galleries of similar diameter to that of the animal. We studied the muscle physiology and morphological attributes of digging effort in the Brazilian amphisbaenid Leposternon microcephalum (Squamata; Amphisbaenia), which burrows by compressing soil against the upper wall of the tunnel by means of upward strokes of the head. The individuals tested (<72 g) exerted forces on the soil of up to 24 N. These forces were possible because the fibres of the longissimus dorsi, the main muscle associated with burrowing, are highly pennated, thus increasing effective muscle cross-sectional area. The muscle is characterized by a metabolic transition along its length: proximal, medial and distal fibres are fast contracting and moderately oxidative, but fibres closer to the head are richer in citrate synthase and more aerobic in nature. Distal fibres, then, might be active mainly at the final step of the compression stroke, which requires more power. For animals greater than a given diameter, the work required to compress soil increases exponentially with body diameter. Leposternon microcephalum, and probably some other highly specialized amphisbaenids, are most likely constrained to small diameters and can increase muscle mass and effective muscle cross-sectional area by increasing body length, not body diameter.},

	abstract = {Molecular clock methods allow biologists to estimate divergence times, which in turn play an important role in comparative studies of many evolutionary processes. It is well known that molecular age estimates can be biased by heterogeneity in rates of molecular evolution, but less attention has been paid to the issue of potentially erroneous fossil calibrations. In this study we estimate the timing of diversification in Centrarchidae, an endemic major lineage of the diverse North American freshwater fish fauna, through a new approach to fossil calibration and molecular evolutionary model selection. Given a completely resolved multi-gene molecular phylogeny and a set of multiple fossil-inferred age estimates, we tested for potentially erroneous fossil calibrations using a recently developed fossil cross-validation. We also used fossil information to guide the selection of the optimal molecular evolutionary model with a new fossil jackknife method in a fossil-based model cross-validation. The centrarchid phylogeny resulted from a mixed-model Bayesian strategy that included 14 separate data partitions sampled from three mtDNA and four nuclear genes. Ten of the 31 interspecific nodes in the centrarchid phylogeny were assigned a minimal age estimate from the centrarchid fossil record. Our analyses identified four fossil dates that were inconsistent with the other fossils, and we removed them from the molecular dating analysis. Using fossil-based model cross -validation to determine the optimal smoothing value in penalized likelihood analysis, and six mutually consistent fossil calibrations, the age of the most recent common ancestor of Centrarchidae was 33.59 million years ago (mya). Penalized likelihood analyses of individual data partitions all converged on a very similar age estimate for this node, indicating that rate heterogeneity among data partitions is not confounding our analyses. These results place the origin of the centrarchid radiation at a time of major faunal turnover as the fossil record indicates that the most diverse lineages of the North American freshwater fish fauna originated at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, approximately 34 mya. This time coincided with major global climate change from warm to cool temperatures and a signature of elevated lineage extinction and origination in the fossil record across the tree of life. Our analyses demonstrate the utility of fossil cross-validation to critically assess individual fossil calibration points, providing the ability to discriminate between consistent and inconsistent fossil age estimates that are used for calibrating molecular phylogenies.},

	abstract = {Notothenioids represent an adaptive radiation of teleost fishes in the frigid and ice-laden waters of the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica. Phylogenetic hypotheses for this clade have resulted primarily from analyses of mtDNA gene sequences, and studies utilizing nuclear gene DNA sequence data have focused on particular sub-clades of notothenioid fishes. In this study, we provide the first phylogenetic analysis of notothenioids using both mtDNA and nuclear gene sequences for a comprehensive sampling of all major lineages in the clade. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of aligned mtDNA genes, an aligned nuclear gene (S7 ribosomal protein intron 1), and combined dataset containing the mtDNA and nuclear genes resulted in phylogenies that contained the previously identified Antarctic and High Antarctic Clades. There were areas of agreement and disagreement between different datasets and methods of phylogenetic analysis, and the phylogenies resulting from the nuclear encoded S7 ribosomal protein intron I sequences were considerably less resolved than those inferred from mtDNA gene sequences. However, we anticipate increased resolution of the notothenioid phylogeny from future analyses that sample DNA sequences from several nuclear genes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {When many protein sequences are available for estimating the time of divergence between two species, it is customary to estimate the time for each protein separately and then use the average for all proteins as the final estimate. However, it can be shown that this estimate generally has an upward bias, and that an unbiased estimate is obtained by using distances based on concatenated sequences. We have shown that two concatenation-based distances, i.e., average gamma distance weighted with sequence length (d(2)) and multiprotein gamma distance (d(3)), generally give more satisfactory results than other concatenation-based distances. Using these two distance measures for 104 protein sequences, we estimated the time of divergence between mice and rats to be approximately 33 million years ago. Similarly, the time of divergence between humans and rodents was estimated to be approximately 96 million years ago. We also investigated the dependency of time estimates on statistical methods and various assumptions made by using sequence data from eubacteria, protists, plants, fungi, and animals. Our best estimates of the times of divergence between eubacteria and eukaryotes, between protists and other eukaryotes, and between plants, fungi, and animals were 3, 1.7, and 1.3 billion years ago, respectively. However, estimates of ancient divergence times are subject to a substantial amount of error caused by uncertainty of the molecular clock, horizontal gene transfer, errors in sequence alignments, etc.},

	abstract = {Statistical methods for estimating divergence times by using multiprotein gamma distances are discussed. When a large number of proteins are used, even a small degree of deviation from the molecular clock hypothesis can be detected. In this case, one may use the stem-lineage method for estimating divergence times. However, the estimates obtained by this method are often similar to those obtained by the linearized tree method. Application of these methods to a dataset of 104 proteins from several vertebrate species indicated that the divergence times between humans and mice and between mice and rats are about 96 and 33 million years (MY) ago, respectively. These estimates were obtained by assuming that birds and mammals diverged 310 MY ago. Similarly application of the methods to the protein sequence data from primate species indicated that the human lineage separated from the chimpanzee, gorilla, Old World monkeys, and New World monkeys about 6.0, 7.0, 23.0, and 33.0 MY ago, respectively. In this case the use of two calibration points, that is, the divergence time (13 MY ago) between humans and orangutans and between primates and artiodactyls (90 MY ago) gave essentially the same estimates.},

	abstract = {The recent development of Bayesian phylogenetic inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo( MCMC) techniques has facilitated the exploration of parameter-rich evolutionary models. At the same time, stochastic models have become more realistic ( and complex) and have been extended to new types of data, such as morphology. Based on this foundation, we developed a Bayesian MCMC approach to the analysis of combined data sets and explored its utility in inferring relationships among gall wasps based on data from morphology and four genes ( nuclear and mitochondrial, ribosomal and protein coding). Examined models range in complexity from those recognizing only a morphological and a molecular partition to those having complex substitution models with independent parameters for each gene. Bayesian MCMC analysis deals efficiently with complex models: convergence occurs faster and more predictably for complex models, mixing is adequate for all parameters even under very complex models, and the parameter update cycle is virtually unaffected by model partitioning across sites. Morphology contributed only 5% of the characters in the data set but nevertheless influenced the combined-data tree, supporting the utility of morphological data in multigene analyses. We used Bayesian criteria ( Bayes factors) to show that process heterogeneity across data partitions is a significant model component, although not as important as among-site rate variation. More complex evolutionary models are associated with more topological uncertainty and less conflict between morphology and molecules. Bayes factors sometimes favor simpler models over considerably more parameter-rich models, but the best model overall is also the most complex and Bayes factors do not support exclusion of apparently weak parameters from this model. Thus, Bayes factors appear to be useful for selecting among complex models, but it is still unclear whether their use strikes a reasonable balance between model complexity and error in parameter estimates.},

	abstract = {The phylogeny of the thrushes (Aves: Turdus) has been difficult to reconstruct due to short internal branches and lack of node support for certain parts of the tree. Reconstructing the biogeographic history of this group is further complicated by the fact that current implementations of biogeographic methods, such as dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA; Ronquist, 1997), require a fully resolved tree. Here, we apply a Bayesian approach to dispersal-vicariance analysis that accounts for phylogenetic uncertainty and allows a more accurate analysis of the biogeographic history of lineages. Specifically, ancestral area reconstructions can be presented as marginal distributions, thus displaying the underlying topological uncertainty. Moreover, if there are multiple optimal solutions for a single node on a certain tree, integrating over the posterior distribution of trees often reveals a preference for a narrower set of solutions. We find that despite the uncertainty in tree topology, ancestral area reconstructions indicate that the Turdus clade originated in the eastern Palearctic during the Late Miocene. This was followed by an early dispersal to Africa from where a worldwide radiation took place. The uncertainty in tree topology and short branch lengths seems to indicate that this radiation took place within a limited time span during the Late Pliocene. The results support the role of Africa as a probable source area for intercontinental dispersals as suggested for other passerine groups, including basal diversification within the songbird tree.},

	abstract = {Patterns of species richness reflect the balance between speciation and extinction over the evolutionary history of life. These processes are influenced by the size and geographical complexity of regions, conditions of the environment, and attributes of individuals and species. Diversity within clades also depends on age and thus the time available for accumulating species. Estimating rates of diversification is key to understanding how these factors have shaped patterns of species richness. Several approaches to calculating both relative and absolute rates of speciation and extinction within clades are based on phylogenetic reconstructions of evolutionary relationships. As the size and quality of phylogenies increases, these approaches will find broader application. However, phylogeny reconstruction fosters a perceptual bias of continual increase in species richness, and the analysis of primarily large clades produces a data selection bias. Recognizing these biases will encourage the development of more realistic models of diversification and the regulation of species richness.},

@article{Ronquist:1997,
	abstract = {Quantification in historical biogeography has usually been based on the search for a single branching relationship among areas of endemism. Unlike organisms, however, areas rarely have a unique hierarchical history. Dispersal barriers appear and disappear and may have different effects on different species. As a result, the biota of an area may consist of several components with separate histories, each of which may be reticulate rather than branching. In an attempt to address these problems, I present a new biogeographic method, dispersal-vicariance analysis, which reconstructs the ancestral distributions in a given phylogeny without any prior assumptions about the form of area relationships. A three-dimensional step matrix based on a simple biogeographic model is used in the reconstruction. Speciation is assumed to subdivide the ranges of widespread species into vicariant components; the optimal ancestral distributions are those that minimize the number of implied dispersal and extinction events. Exact algorithms that find the optimal reconstruction(s) are described. In addition to their use in taxon biogeography, the inferred distribution histories of individual groups serve as a basis for the study of general patterns in historical biogeography, particularly if the relative age of the nodes in the source cladograms is known.},

	abstract = {Much recent progress in evolutionary biology is based on the inference of ancestral states and past transformations in important traits on phylogenetic trees. These exercises often assume that the tree is known without error and that ancestral states and character change can be mapped onto it exactly. In reality, there is often considerable uncertainty about both the tree and the character mapping. Recently introduced Bayesian statistical methods enable the study of character evolution while simultaneously accounting for both phylogenetic and mapping uncertainty, adding much needed credibility to the reconstruction of evolutionary history.},

@article{Rowe:2008kr,
	abstract = {The old endemic rodents of Australia and New Guinea (Sahul) represent one or more large adaptive radiations including novel morphological adaptations to aquatic, arboreal, hopping, and and ecologies. Four tribes recognized among the Sahulian old endemics (Hydromini, Conilurini, Anisomyini, and Uromyini) reflect distinct biogeographic and ecomorphological hypotheses about diversification within the Old Endemics. We present the first character-based phylogeny of the Sahulian Old Endemic rodents with broad sampling, nested within a broader phylogeny of the Murinae. We estimated phylogenies from >2500 nucleotides of mtDNA sequence and >9500 nucleotides from six autosomal nuclear loci, for individual genes and for the full concatenated data using parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Our results strongly supported monophyly of the group and its sister relationship to the Philippine old endemics of the Chrotomys division. Most striking was the rapid diversification after the Late Miocene or Early Pliocene colonization of New Guinea from the west, consistent with a single colonization of the Sahulian continent. That was followed 2-3 My later by a second adaptive radiation resulting from one or more colonizations of Australia. Monophyly was not supported for the Anisomyini or the Conilurini but was for the Uromyini nested within the Conilurini and for the Hydromyini. Conflict among gene phylogenies was weak, and support for the consensus topology increased with more (even conflicting) data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The recent contribution of molecular data is shedding new light on this debate, but many important questions still remain unresolved. I have assembled a large and comprehensive multilocus dataset (the largest to date in terms of number and heterogeneity of sequence characters) combining mitogenomic and nuclear information from 23 genes for a sufficiently dense taxon sampling with the key major lineages of extant amphibians. This dataset has been used to infer a robust phylogenetic framework and molecular timescale for the origin of extant amphibians employing the most recent phylogenetic and dating methods, as well as several alternative calibration schemes. The monophyly of each extant amphibian order and the sister group relationship between frogs and salamanders (Batrachia hypothesis) are all strongly supported. Dating analyses (all methods and calibration schemes used) suggest that the origin of extant amphibians (divergence between caecilian and batrachians) occurred in the Late Carboniferous, around 315 Mya, and the divergence between frogs and salamanders occurred in the Early Permian, around 290 Mya. These age estimates are more consistent with the fossil record than previous older estimates, and more in line with the Temnospondyli or the Lepospondyli hypotheses of lissamphibian ancestry (although the polyphyly hypothesis cannot be completely ruled out).

Consequently the size of phylogenetic analyses has grown as well, and phylogenetic methods, algorithms and their implementations have struggled to keep pace. Computational and other challenges raised by this burgeoning database emerge at several stages of analysis, from the optimal assembly of large data matrices from sequence databases, to the efficient construction of trees from these large matrices and the piece-wise assembly of 'supertrees' from those trees in turn. A final challenge is posed by the difficulty of visualizing and making inferences from trees that might soon routinely contain thousands of species.},

@article{Sanmartin:2001,
	abstract = {We analysed patterns of animal dispersal, vicariance and diversification in the Holarctic based on complete phylogenies of 57 extant non-marine taxa, together comprising 170 species, documenting biogeographic events from the Late Mesozoic to the present. Four major areas, each corresponding to a historically persistent landmass, were used in the analyses: eastern Nearctic (EN), western Nearctic (WN), eastern Palaeoarctic (EP) and western Palaeoarctic (WP). Parsimony-based tree fitting showed that there is no significantly supported general area cladogram for the dataset. Yet, distributions are strongly phylogenetically conserved, as revealed by dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA). DIVA-based permutation tests were used to pinpoint phylogenetieally determined biogeographic patterns. Consistent with expectations, continental dispersals (WP <----> EP and WN <----> EN) are significantly more common than palaeocontinental dispersals (WN <----> EP and EN <----> WP), which in turn are more common than disjunct dispersals (EN <----> EP and WN <----> WP). There is significant dispersal asymmetry both within the Nearctic (WN --> EN more common than EN --> WN) and the Palaeoarctic (EP --> WP more common than WP --> EP). Cross-Beringian faunal connections have traditionally been emphasized but are not more important than cross-Atlantic connections in our data set. To analyse changes over time, we sorted biogeographic events into four major time periods using fossil, biogeographic and molecular evidence combined with a branching clock'. These analyses show that trans-Atlantic distributions (EN-WP) were common in the Early-Mid Tertiary (70-20 Myr), whereas trans-Beringian distributions (WN-EP) were rare in that period. Most EN-EP disjunctions date back to the Early Tertiary (70-45 Myr), suggesting that they resulted from division of cross-Atlantic rather than cross-Beringian distributions. Diversification in WN and WP increased in the Quaternary (< 3 Myr), whereas in EP and EN it decreased from a maximum in the Early-Mid Tertiary. (C) 2001 The Linnean Society of London.},

	abstract = {Despite its role in whole-animal performance, the adaptation of muscle physiology related to terrestrial locomotion remains underexplored. We tested evolutionary models based on predator escape and foraging strategies of lizards to assess whether fiber-type composition of a leg muscle is adaptive for behavior. The best-fitting model for fast-twitch fiber-type evolution was one based on predator-escape strategy, while the foraging-mode model fared poorly (Akaike Information Criterion with small sample size correction; Delta AICc = 29.7). According to the predator escape model, lizards relying on sprints to avoid predators are predicted to have relatively higher proportions of fast glycolytic (FG) fibers (70%), while cryptic lizards are predicted to have relatively higher fast oxidative glycolytic (FOG) fiber proportions (77%). This pattern suggests an evolutionary trend toward greater FG (FOG) fiber composition among lizards that specialize in sprinting (crypsis). The best-fitting model for slow-twitch fibers had a single optimum, suggesting a common selective pressure across these lizards. The second-best model explaining slow-twitch fiber-type evolution was Brownian motion (Delta AICc = 0.80), indicating some support for neutral evolution. We find evidence suggesting that different fiber types occurring in the same muscle can evolve under different evolutionary pressures.},

	abstract = {Theories of ecological diversification make predictions about the timing and ordering of character state changes through history. These theories are testable by "reconstructing" ancestor states using phylogenetic trees and measurements of contemporary species. Here we use maximum likelihood to estimate and evaluate the accuracy of ancestor reconstructions. We present likelihoods of discrete ancestor states and derive probability distributions for continuous ancestral traits. The methods are applied to several examples: diets of ancestral Darwin's finches; origin of inquilinism in gall wasps; microhabitat partitioning and body size evolution in scrubwrens; digestive enzyme evolution in artiodactyl mammals; origin of a sexually selected male trait, the sword, in platies and swordtails; and evolution of specialization in Anolis lizards. When changes between discrete character states are rare, the maximum likelihood results are similar to parsimony estimates. In this case the accuracy of estimates is often high, with the exception of some nodes deep in the tree. If change is frequent then reconstructions are highly uncertain, especially of distant ancestors. Ancestor states for continuous traits are typically highly uncertain. We conclude that measures of uncertainty are useful and should always be provided, despite simplistic assumptions about the probabilistic models that underlie them. If uncertainty is too high, reconstruction should be abandoned in favor of approaches that fit different models of trait evolution to species data and phylogenetic trees, taking into account the range of ancestor states permitted by the data.},

@article{Schluter:2000,
	abstract = {I give an overview of the observational and experimental evidence for ecological character displacement in adaptive radiation. Sixty-one published cases of character displacement involving closely related species (congeners) make up the observational data set. All cases involve divergence, even though parallel and convergent displacement are theoretically possible. Character ratios in sympatry were greatest when displacement was symmetric (mean 1.54) and least when asymmetric (mean 1.29), perhaps because the most symmetric resource distributions are also the broadest. Carnivores are vastly overrepresented in the data compared with other trophic groups, with herbivores the next most common category. I consider five hypotheses to explain this pattern, including the possibility that the likelihood of divergence via competition depends on position in food webs. Overall, the quality and completeness of observational data has improved in recent pars, as judged by the extent to which individual cases satisfy six standard criteria. All but one of the criteria are met in over half the cases. Most often lacking is independent evidence that the species involved compete for resources. For this reason, we cannot be sure that divergence in sympatry is usually the result of resource competition rather than some other interaction. Field experiments on character displacement, which explore how interaction strength changes per unit change in phenotypic traits, are only just beginning. I summarize research on threespine sticklebacks that used experiments in ponds to test three predictions: that present-day differences between sympatric species are a ``ghost'' of competition past; that adding a competitor alters natural selection pressures on a species already present, favoring divergence; and that divergent natural selection stemming from resource competition is frequency dependent. In total, the evidence suggests that character displacement occurs frequently in nature, and it probably plays an important role in the evolution of diversity in many adaptive radiations.},

	abstract = {Galagete is a genus of microlepidoptera including 12 nominate species endemic to the Galapagos Islands. In order to better understand the diversification of this endemic insular radiation, to unravel relationships among species and populations, and to get insight into the early stages of speciation, we developed a phylogenetic reconstruction based on the combined mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (555 bp) and II (453 bp), and the nuclear elongation factor-1 alpha (711 bp) and wingless (351 bp) genes. Monophyly of the genus is strongly supported in the Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses suggesting a single colonization event by a common ancestor. Two cases of paraphyly observed between species are hypothesized to represent imperfect species limits for G. espanolaensis nested within the G. turritella clade, and introgressive hybridization or lineage sorting in the case of the population of G. protozona from Santa Fe nested within the G. gnathodoxa clade. A geologically calibrated, relaxed molecular clock model was used for the first time to unravel the chronological sequence of an insular radiation. The first split occurring within the Galagete lineage on the archipelago is estimated at 3.3 +/- 0.4 million years ago. The genus radiated relatively quickly in about 1.8 million years, and gives an estimated speciation rate of 0.8 species per million years. Although the colonization scenario shows a stochastic dispersal pattern, the arrival of the ancestor and the diversification of the radiation coincide with the chronological emergence of the major islands.

	abstract = {Aim To examine the biogeographical history of the angiosperm clade Caprifolieae (Caprifoliaceae) using parametric biogeographical reconstruction methods. The existing parametric method was extended to evaluate biogeographical reconstructions over the distribution of dated phylogenies. This method provides a framework for reconstructing large-scale biogeography with parametric methods, while accounting for uncertainty in the phylogenetic relationships and divergence time. Location Asia, Europe and North America. Methods The biogeographical history of the major lineages of Caprifolieae was reconstructed over the posterior distribution of dated trees generated from Bayesian divergence-time analyses. Results from a model with no geological constraints were compared with those from one where movement is disallowed across the North Atlantic after the Eocene. The most plausible scenarios were segregated at each node to test whether particular scenarios were reconstructed for particular divergence times. The parametric biogeographical method was also extended to estimate connectivity between areas so that the probability of dispersal between the major areas of the Northern Hemisphere could be explored. Results Phylogenetic results for Caprifolieae agreed with previous estimates using smaller sampling, but uncertainty remained despite efforts to resolve the relationships of the four genera within this clade using multiple markers. In addition to topological uncertainty, there were few fossils available for calibrations, resulting in large confidence intervals for divergence times. Divergence-time analyses put the diversification of Caprifolieae at between 36 and 51 Ma and showed that Caprifolieae probably originated in Asia, with multiple movements into Europe and western and eastern North America. Main conclusions Newly developed parametric methods for biogeographical reconstruction incorporate more data and better models. Here, the parametric biogeographical reconstruction method has been extended to allow for topological and divergence-time uncertainty. The analyses of Caprifolieae demonstrated that biogeographical hypotheses can be explored even where there are large confidence intervals on divergence times and uncertainty in topology. These results add to the growing evidence that Asia was an important source of Northern Hemisphere diversity throughout the Cenozoic.},

	abstract = {In a 1997 seminal paper, W. Maddison proposed minimizing deep coalescences, or MDC, as an optimization criterion for inferring the species tree from a set of incongruent gene trees, assuming the incongruence is exclusively due to lineage sorting. In a subsequent paper, Maddison and Knowles provided and implemented a search heuristic for optimizing the MDC criterion, given a set of gene trees. However, the heuristic is not guaranteed to compute optimal solutions, and its hill-climbing search makes it slow in practice. In this paper, we provide two exact solutions to the problem of inferring the species tree from a set of gene trees under the MDC criterion. In other words, our solutions are guaranteed to find the tree that minimizes the total number of deep coalescences from a set of gene trees. One solution is based on a novel integer linear programming (ILP) formulation, and another is based on a simple dynamic programming (DP) approach. Powerful ILP solvers, such as CPLEX, make the first solution appealing, particularly for very large-scale instances of the problem, whereas the DP-based solution eliminates dependence on proprietary tools, and its simplicity makes it easy to integrate with other genomic events that may cause gene tree incongruence. Using the exact solutions, we analyze a data set of 106 loci from eight yeast species, a data set of 268 loci from eight Apicomplexan species, and several simulated data sets. We show that the MDC criterion provides very accurate estimates of the species tree topologies, and that our solutions are very fast, thus allowing for the accurate analysis of genome-scale data sets. Further, the efficiency of the solutions allow for quick exploration of sub-optimal solutions, which is important for a parsimony-based criterion such as MDC, as we show. We show that searching for the species tree in the compatibility graph of the clusters induced by the gene trees may be sufficient in practice, a finding that helps ameliorate the computational requirements of optimization solutions. Further, we study the statistical consistency and convergence rate of the MDC criterion, as well as its optimality in inferring the species tree. Finally, we show how our solutions can be used to identify potential horizontal gene transfer events that may have caused some of the incongruence in the data, thus augmenting Maddison's original framework. We have implemented our solutions in the PhyloNet software package, which is freely available at: http://bioinfo.cs.rice.edu/phylonet.},

@article{Thomson:2008ts,
	abstract = {We present a strategy for phylogenetic marker development in non-model systems. Rather than using the traditional approach of comparing distantly related taxa to develop conserved primers for unknown species, we explore an alternative strategy that builds primers directly from a single, relatively well characterized species and applies those primers to increasingly distantly related taxa. We develop and test our protocol with turtles. Using a single BAC end-sequence library consisting of 3461 sequences totaling 2.43 million base pairs of data, we outline a procedure to flag repeat elements, followed by a BLAST approach to categorize sequences into high, low, and no similarity compartments compared to GenBank sequences. We developed and tested a panel of 96 primer pairs with a set of turtle tissues that forms a series of increasingly distantly related taxa with respect to the BAC reference species. Finally, we sequenced 11 of these newly discovered markers across a diverse set of 18 turtle species that spans the 210 million years of chelonian crown-group history and that includes representatives of most of the major clades of extant turtles. Our results indicate that large numbers of new, phylogenetically informative markers can be developed quickly and inexpensively from a single BAC, EST, or similar genomic resource, and that those markers provide reliable phylogenetic information across both shallow and deep levels of phylogenetic history. Our results also highlight the importance of screening for and managing repetitive elements found in randomly sequenced DNA fragments. We presume that our strategy should work well across any similarly divergent clade, suggesting that many-marker datasets can be developed quickly and efficiently for phylogenetic analysis.

@article{Turner:2001cq,
	abstract = {The endemic cichlid fishes of Lakes Malawi, Tanganyika and Victoria are textbook examples of explosive speciation and adaptive radiation, and their study promises to yield important insights into these processes. Accurate estimates of species richness of lineages in these lakes, and elsewhere, will be a necessary prerequisite for a thorough comparative analysis of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing rates of diversification. This review presents recent findings on the discoveries of new species and species flocks and critically appraises the relevant evidence on species richness from recent studies of polymorphism and assortative mating, generally using behavioural and molecular methods. Within the haplochromines, the most species-rich lineage, there are few reported cases of postzygotic isolation, and these are generally among allopatric taxa that are likely to have diverged a relatively long time in the past. However, many taxa, including many which occur sympatrically and do not interbreed in nature, produce viable, fertile hybrids. Prezygotic barriers are more important, and persist in laboratory conditions in which environmental factors have been controlled, indicating the primary importance of direct mate preferences. Studies to date indicate that estimates of alpha (within-site) diversify appear to be robust. Although within-species colour polymorphisms are common, these have been taken into account in previous estimates of species richness. However, overall estimates of species richness in Lakes Malawi and Victoria are heavily dependent on the assignation of species status to allopatric populations differing in male colour. Appropriate methods for testing the specific status of allopatric cichlid taxa are reviewed and preliminary results presented.},

	abstract = {Studies of the evolution of phenotypic diversity have gained momentum among neontologists interested in the uneven distribution of diversity across the tree of life. Potential morphological diversity in a lineage is a function of the number of independent parameters required to describe the form, and innovations such as structural duplication and functional decoupling can enhance the potential for diversity in a given Glade. The functional properties of organisms are determined by underlying parts, but any property that is determined by three or more parts expresses many-to-one mapping of form to function, in which many morphologies will have the same functional property. This ubiquitous feature of organismal design results in surfaces of morphological variation that are neutral with respect to the functional property, and enhances the potential for simultaneously optimizing two or more functions of the system.},

	abstract = {In the past, molecular clocks have been used to estimate divergence times among animal phyla, but those time estimates have varied widely (1200-670 million years ago, Ma). In order to obtain time estimates that are more robust, we have analysed a larger number of genes for divergences among three well-represented animal phyla, and among plants, animals and fungi. The time estimate for the chordate-arthropod divergence, using 50 genes, is 993 +/- 46 Ma. Nematodes were found to have diverged from the lineage leading to arthropods and chordates at 1177 +/- 79 Ma. Phylogenetic analyses also show that a basal position of nematodes has strong support (p>99\%) and is not the result of rate biases. The three-way split (relationships unresolved) of plants, animals and fungi was estimated at 1576 +/- 88 Ma. By inference, the basal animal phyla (Porifera, Cnidaria, Ctenophora) diverged between about 1200-1500 Ma. This suggests that at least six animal phyla originated deep in the Precambrian, more than 400 million years earlier than their first appearance in the fossil record.},

@article{Wiens:1998et,
	abstract = {The possibility that two data sets may have different underlying: phylogenetic histories (such as gene trees that deviate from species trees) has become an important argument against combining data in phylogenetic analysis. However, two data sets sampled for a large number of taxa may differ in only part of their histories. This is a realistic scenario and one in which the relative advantages of combined, separate, and consensus analysis become much less clear. I propose a simple methodology for dealing with this situation that involves (1) partitioning the available data to maximize detection of different histories, (2) performing separate analyses of the data sets, and (3) combining the data but considering questionable or unresolved those parts of the combined tree that are strongly contested in the separate analyses (and which therefore may have different histories) until a majority of unlinked data sets support one resolution over another. In support of this methodology, computer simulations suggest that (1) the accuracy of combined analysis for recovering the true species phylogeny may exceed that of either of two separately analyzed data sets under some conditions, particularly when the mismatch between phylogenetic histories is small and the estimates of the underlying histories are imperfect (few characters, high homoplasy, or both) and (2) combined analysis provides a poor estimate of the species tree in areas of the phylogenies with different histories but gives an improved estimate in regions that share the same history. Thus, when there is a localized mismatch between the histories of two data sets, the separate, consensus, and combined analyses may all give unsatisfactory results in certain parts of the phylogeny. Similarly, approaches that allow data combination only after a global test of heterogeneity will suffer from the potential failings of either separate or combined analysis, depending on the outcome of the test. Excision of conflicting taxa is also problematic, in that doing so may obfuscate the position of conflicting taxa within a larger tree, even when their placement is congruent between data sets. Application of the proposed methodology to molecular and morphological data sets fur Sceloporus lizards is discussed.},

	abstract = {
Ecology and historical (phylogeny-based) biogeography have much to offer one another, but exchanges between these fields have been limited. Historical biogeography has become narrowly focused on using phylogenies to discover the history of geological connections among regions. Conversely, ecologists often ignore historical biogeography, even when its input can be crucial. Both historical biogeographers and ecologists have more-or-less abandoned attempts to understand the processes that determine the large-scale distribution of clades. Here, we describe the chasm that has developed between ecology and historical biogeography, some of the important questions that have fallen into it and how it might be bridged. To illustrate the benefits of an integrated approach, we expand on a model that can help explain the latitudinal gradient of species richness.},

	abstract = {How should characters and taxa be sampled to resolve efficiently the phylogeny of ancient and highly speciose groups? We addressed this question empirically in the treefrog family Hylidae, which contains >800 species and may be nonmonophyletic with respect to other anuran families. We sampled 81 species (54 hylids and 27 outgroups) for two mitochondrial genes (12S, ND1), two nuclear genes ( POMC, c-myc), and morphology (144 characters) in an attempt to resolve higher-level relationships. We then added 117 taxa to the combined data set, many of which were sampled for only one gene (12S). Despite the relative incompleteness of the majority of taxa, the resulting trees placed all taxa in the expected higher-level clades with strong support, despite some taxa being >90\% incomplete. Furthermore, we found no relationship between the completeness of a taxon and the support (parsimony bootstrap or Bayesian posterior probabilities) for its localized placement on the tree. Separate analysis of the data set with the most taxa (12S) gives a somewhat problematic estimate of higher-level relationships, suggesting that data sets scored only for some taxa (ND1, nuclear genes, morphology) are important in determining the outcome of the combined analysis. The results show that hemiphractine hylids are not closely related to other hylids and should be recognized as a distinct family. They also show that the speciose genus Hyla is polyphyletic, but that its species can be arranged into three monophyletic genera. A new classification of hylid frogs is proposed. Several potentially misleading signals in the morphological data are discussed.},

	abstract = {Adaptive radiations of mammals have contributed to the exceptionally high levels of biodiversity and endemism in Madagascar. Here we examine the evolutionary history of the endemic dung beetle tribe Helictopleurini (Scarabaeidae) and its relationship to the widely distributed Oniticellini and Onthophagini. Helictopleurini species are dependent on mammals for their resources. We date the single origin of the tribe, at 37 to 23 MY ago, indicating overseas colonization of Madagascar. The main radiation occurred concurrently with the main radiations of lemurs. The ancestors of Helictopleurini are inferred to have been coprophagous species inhabiting open habitats. Subsequent evolution has involved a shift into forests, changes in resource use to a more generalized diet, and changes in body size. Four species of the extant 65 species have shifted to use the dung of the recently introduced cattle in open habitats, allowing these species to greatly expand their geographical ranges.

	abstract = {A timescale is necessary for estimating rates of molecular and morphological change in organisms and for interpreting patterns of macroevolution and biogeography(1-9). Traditionally, these times have been obtained from the fossil record, where the earliest representatives of two lineages establish a minimum time of divergence of these lineages(10). The clock-like accumulation of sequence differences in some genes provides an alternative method(11) by which the mean divergence time can be estimated. Estimates from single genes may have large statistical errors, but multiple genes can be studied to obtain a more reliable estimate of divergence time(1,12-13). However, until recently, the number of genes available for estimation of divergence time has been limited. Here we present divergence-time estimates for mammalian orders and major lineages of vertebrates, from an analysis of 658 nuclear genes. The molecular times agree with most early (Palaeozoic) and late (Cenozoic) fossil-based times, but indicate major gaps in the Mesozoic fossil record. At least five lineages of placental mammals arose more than 100 million years ago, and most of the modern orders seem to have diversified before the Cretaceous/Tertiary extinction of the dinosaurs.},

It is unclear how to integrate data from many genes, each potentially evolving under a different model of substitution and at a different rate. Current methods can be grouped by the Way the data are handled (genes considered separately or combined into a 'supergene') and the way gene-specific rate models are applied (global versus local clock). There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these approaches, and the optimal method has not yet emerged. Fortunately, time estimates inferred using many genes or proteins have greater precision and appear to be robust to different approaches.},

	abstract = {In historical biogeography, phylogenetic trees have long been used as tools for addressing a wide range of inference problems, from explaining common distribution patterns of species to reconstructing ancestral geographic ranges on branches of the tree of life. However, the potential utility of phylogenies for this purpose has yet to be fully realized, due in part to a lack of explicit conceptual links between processes underlying the evolution of geographic ranges and processes of phylogenetic tree growth. We suggest that statistical approaches that use parametric models to forge such links will stimulate integration and propel hypothesis-driven biogeographical inquiry in new directions. We highlight here two such approaches and describe how they represent early steps towards a more general framework for model-based historical biogeography that is based on likelihood as an optimality criterion, rather than having the traditional reliance on parsimony. The development of this framework will not be without significant challenges, particularly in balancing model complexity with statistical power, and these will be most apparent in studies of regions with many component areas and complex geological histories, such as the Mediterranean Basin.},

	abstract = {At a time when historical biogeography appears to be again expanding its scope after a period of focusing primarily on discerning area relationships using cladograms, new inference methods are needed to bring more kinds of data to bear on questions about the geographic history of lineages. Here we describe a likelihood framework for inferring the evolution of geographic range on phylogenies that models lineage dispersal and local extinction in a set of discrete areas as stochastic events in continuous time. Unlike existing methods for estimating ancestral areas, such as dispersal-vicariance analysis, this approach incorporates information on the timing of both lineage divergences and the availability of connections between areas (dispersal routes). Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate branch-specific transition probabilities for geographic ranges, enabling the likelihood of the data (observed species distributions) to be evaluated for a given phylogeny and parameterized paleogeographic model. We demonstrate how the method can be used to address two biogeographic questions: What were the ancestral geographic ranges on a phylogenetic tree? How were those ancestral ranges affected by speciation and inherited by the daughter lineages at cladogenesis events? For illustration we use hypothetical examples and an analysis of a Northern Hemisphere plant clade (Cercis), comparing and contrasting inferences to those obtained from dispersal-vicariance analysis. Although the particular model we implement is somewhat simplistic, the framework itself is flexible and could readily be modified to incorporate additional sources of information and also be extended to address other aspects of historical biogeography.},

@article{Ree:2008,
	abstract = {In historical biogeography, model-based inference methods for reconstructing the evolution of geographic ranges on phylogenetic trees are poorly developed relative to the diversity of analogous methods available for inferring character evolution. We attempt to rectify this deficiency by constructing a dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model for geographic range evolution that specifies instantaneous transition rates between discrete states (ranges) along phylogenetic branches and apply it to estimating likelihoods of ancestral states (range inheritance scenarios) at cladogenesis events. Unlike an earlier version of this approach, the present model allows for an analytical solution to probabilities of range transitions as a function of time, enabling free parameters in the model, rates of dispersal, and local extinction to be estimated by maximum likelihood. Simulation results indicate that accurate parameter estimates may be difficult to obtain in practice but also show that ancestral range inheritance scenarios nevertheless can be correctly recovered with high success if rates of range evolution are low relative to the rate of cladogenesis. We apply the DEC model to a previously published, exemplary case study of island biogeography involving Hawaiian endemic angiosperms in Psychotria (Rubiaceae), showing how the DEC model can be iteratively refined from inspecting inferences of range evolution and also how geological constraints involving times of island origin may be imposed on the likelihood function. The DEC model is sufficiently similar to character models that it might serve as a gateway through which many existing comparative methods for characters could be imported into the realm of historical biogeography; moreover, it might also inspire the conceptual expansion of character models toward inclusion of evolutionary change as directly coincident, either as cause or consequence, with cladogenesis events. The DEC model is thus an incremental advance that highlights considerable potential in the nascent field of model-based historical biogeographic inference.},

	abstract = {A plate tectonic model for the Cenozoic development of the region of SE Asia and the SW Pacific is presented and its implications are discussed. The model is accompanied by computer animations in a variety of formats, which can be viewed on most desk-top computers. GPS measurements and present seismicity illustrate the high rates of motions and tectonic complexity of the region, but provide little help in long-term reconstruction. Plate boundaries shifted rapidly in the Cenozoic. During convergence of the major plates, there were numerous important episodes of extension, forming ocean basins and causing subsidence within continental regions, probably driven by subduction. Within eastern Indonesia, New Guinea and the Melanesian arcs, there are multiple Cenozoic sutures, with very short histories compared to most well-known older orogenic belts. They preserve a record of major changes in tectonics, including subduction polarity reversals, elimination of volcanic arcs, changing plate boundaries and extension within an overall contractional setting. Rapid tectonic changes have occurred within periods of less than 5 Ma. Many events would be overlooked or ignored in older orogenic belts, even when evidence is preserved, because high resolution dating is required to identify them, and the inference of almost simultaneous contraction and extension seems contradictory.

There were three important periods in regional development: at about 45, 25 and 5 Ma. At these times, plate boundaries and motions changed, probably because of major collision events. The 45 Ma plate reorganisation may be related to India-Asia collision, although some important intra-Pacific events, such as voluminous Eocene boninite magmatism, seem to be older and require other causes. Indentation of Asia by India modified the Asian continent, but there is Little indication that India has been the driving force of tectonics in most of SE Asia. The most important Cenozoic plate boundary reorganisation was at about 25 Ma. The New Guinea passive margin collided with the East Philippines-Halmahera-South Caroline Are system. The Australian margin, in the Bird's Head region, also began to collide with the SE Asian margin in Sulawesi. The Ontong Java Plateau collided with the Melanesian Arc. These collisions caused a major change in the character of plate boundaries between about 25 and 20 Ma. Since 25 Ma, tectonic events cast of Eurasia were driven by motion of the Pacific Plate. Further, west, the movement of Australia northwards caused rotations of blocks and accretion of microcontinental fragments to SE Asia, Plate motions and boundaries changed again at about 5 Ma, for uncertain reasons, possibly as a consequence of Pacific Plate motion changes, are-continent collision in Taiwan, or other boundary changes at the Pacific margin, for example in the Philippines,

Areas to the west and east of New Guinea, the Banda Sea and Woodlark Basin, illustrate the speed of change, the unexpected interplay of convergence and extension, and the importance of subduction as the engine of change. Subduction has been the principal driving mechanism for tectonic change, although its manifestations are varied. They include collision-related phenomena, partitioning of oblique convergence, and effects of hinge roll-back and pull forces of subducting slabs. Magmatism is not always associated with subduction, depending on the movement of subduction hinge, and there may be important extension of the upper plate both perpendicular and parallel to the length of subduction zones. Strike-slip faulting is observably very important within the Pacific-Australia-Eurasia convergent setting, yet appears in few tectonic models. Long-term strike-slip deformation can explain some of the complexities of areas such as New Guinea, including magmatism and its absence, and thermo-chronological data showing very young and rapid cooling of the mobile belt and fold belt.

The inadequacies of the tectonic model reflect in part the difficulties of applying rigid plate tectonics, when there is clear evidence of changing shapes of fragments. Geological knowledge of the region is still inadequate and significant improvements to regional data sets, such as palaeomagnetic data and isotopic ages, are required, New tomographic techniques offer an important means of testing this and other reconstructions. However, valuable insights could also be obtained from simple data sets, such as sediment volumes, if more information that is complete were available in the public domain. Two-dimensional plate tectonic cartoons of small areas are no longer adequate descriptions or tools for understanding. It is essential to test plate tectonic models by using animation techniques with reconstructions drawn at short time intervals, which expose flaws in models, show major gaps in knowledge and help identify truly regional events. Observations of present-day tectonics, and all geological evidence, indicate that the model presented here is over-simplified. Improvements in this, or new models, will inevitably be more complex than the reconstructions described here. (C) 2002 R. Hall. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Palaeomagnetic results from the Bewani-Torricelli Arc complex of the North Sepik region, Papua New Guinea, provide new information about latitudinal movement of the region relative to the Australian craton during the Cenozoic and about rotational deformation following accretion of the arc to the craton's northern margin. Thermal demagnetization of more than 200 samples (10 sites) from the Bliri Volcanics complex of Palaeocene to Early Miocene age and from Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene cover sediments show: (i) a primary magnetization component in Plio-Pleistocene pelagic carbonate blocks within the Bliri Volcanics complex, acquired at the equator and indicating southward transport of oceanic lithosphere to its present location at 3.4degreesS; (ii) a predominant overprint in tuffs and volcanics from the Bliri Volcanics complex acquired at about 15degreesS, probably contemporaneous with Early-Middle Miocene accretion of the Bewani-Torricelli Arc onto the northern margin of the Australian craton; (iii) a probably primary magnetization component in pre-Late Oligocene Bliri Volcanics of the Tring Block, immediately east of the main complex, acquired at about 30degreesS; (iv) a Late Oligocene primary magnetization, a post-Middle Miocene post-accretion overprint, and a recent overprint of mainly normal polarity in sediments of the cover sequence, providing further latitudinal control on evolution of the accretionary margin; (v) Large-scale counterclockwise rotations of 30degrees+ to 110degrees+ relative to the Australian craton of both the Bliri Volcanics complex and the cover sediments of the main body of the Bewani-Torricelli Arc, and contrasting clockwise rotations of 100degrees+ to 170degrees+ of the structurally detached Tring Block. These rotations are attributed to sinistral movements along the Tonga-Sulawesi megashear and in particular along the landward continuation of the Bismarck Fracture Zone. The latitudinal evolution of the Bewani-Torricelli Arc shows some similarity with latitude observations from the Baining Arc (Finisteffe-Huon-New Ireland-New Britain), and indicates northward movement from about 30degreesS in the Late Eocene to about 15degreesS in the Early to Middle Miocene. This suggests that both arcs may represent parts of a larger east-west oriented arc complex, which was possibly located on the Pacific plate prior to accretion. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Understanding the evolutionary processes that generate and sustain diversity in tropical faunas has challenged biologists for over a century and should underpin conservation strategies. Molecular studies of diversity within species and relationships among species, when integrated with more traditional approaches of biogeography and paleoecology, have much to contribute to this challenge. Here we outline the current major hypotheses, develop predictions relevant to integrated molecular approaches, and evaluate the current evidence, focusing on central African, Australian, and South American systems. The available data are sparse relative to the scale of the questions. However, the following conclusions can be drawn: (a) in most cases, the divergence of extant sister taxa predates the Pleistocene; (b) areas with high habitat heterogeneity and recent climatic or geological instability appear to harbor more species of recent origin; (c) there is support for both allopatric and gradient models of diversification and mon attention should be given to the role of diversifying selection regardless of geographic context; and (d) conservation strategies should seek to protect heterogeneous landscapes within and adjacent to large rainforest areas, rather than rainforests alone.},

	abstract = {We present a new open source, extensible and flexible software platform for Bayesian evolutionary analysis called BEAST 2. This software platform is a re-design of the popular BEAST 1 platform to correct structural deficiencies that became evident as the BEAST 1 software evolved. Key among those deficiencies was the lack of post-deployment extensibility. BEAST 2 now has a fully developed package management system that allows third party developers to write additional functionality that can be directly installed to the BEAST 2 analysis platform via a package manager without requiring a new software release of the platform. This package architecture is showcased with a number of recently published new models encompassing birth-death-sampling tree priors, phylodynamics and model averaging for substitution models and site partitioning. A second major improvement is the ability to read/write the entire state of the MCMC chain to/from disk allowing it to be easily shared between multiple instances of the BEAST software. This facilitates checkpointing and better support for multi-processor and high-end computing extensions. Finally, the functionality in new packages can be easily added to the user interface (BEAUti 2) by a simple XML template-based mechanism because BEAST 2 has been re-designed to provide greater integration between the analysis engine and the user interface so that, for example BEAST and BEAUti use exactly the same XML file format. },

   fast, flexible software architecture for Bayesian analysis of molecular
   sequences related by an evolutionary tree. A large number of popular
   stochastic models of sequence evolution are provided and tree-based
   models suitable for both within- and between-species sequence data are
   implemented. Results: BEAST version 1.4.6 consists of 81000 lines of

   DNA and protein sequence evolution, highly parametric coalescent
   analysis, relaxed clock phylogenetics, non-contemporaneous sequence
   data, statistical alignment and a wide range of options for prior
   distributions. BEAST source code is object-oriented, modular in design
   and freely available at http://beast-mcmc.googlecode.com/ under the GNU

Many comparisons between biological sequences (nucleic acids and proteins) involve the construction of multiple alignments. Alignments represent a statement regarding the homology between individual nucleotides or amino acids within homologous genes. As protein-coding DNA sequences evolve as triplets of nucleotides (codons) and it is known that sequence similarity degrades more rapidly at the DNA than at the amino acid level, alignments are generally more accurate when based on amino acids than on their corresponding nucleotides. TranslatorX novelties include: (i) use of all documented genetic codes and the possibility of assigning different genetic codes for each sequence; (ii) a battery of different multiple alignment programs; (iii) translation of ambiguous codons when possible; (iv) an innovative criterion to clean nucleotide alignments with GBlocks based on protein information; and (v) a rich output, including Jalview-powered graphical visualization of the alignments, codon-based alignments coloured according to the corresponding amino acids, measures of compositional bias and first, second and third codon position specific alignments.

@article{Ye:2012,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Choosing appropriate primers is probably the single most important factor affecting the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific amplification of the intended target requires that primers do not have matches to other targets in certain orientations and within certain distances that allow undesired amplification. The process of designing specific primers typically involves two stages. First, the primers flanking regions of interest are generated either manually or using software tools; then they are searched against an appropriate nucleotide sequence database using tools such as BLAST to examine the potential targets. However, the latter is not an easy process as one needs to examine many details between primers and targets, such as the number and the positions of matched bases, the primer orientations and distance between forward and reverse primers. The complexity of such analysis usually makes this a time-consuming and very difficult task for users, especially when the primers have a large number of hits. Furthermore, although the BLAST program has been widely used for primer target detection, it is in fact not an ideal tool for this purpose as BLAST is a local alignment algorithm and does not necessarily return complete match information over the entire primer range.
RESULTS: We present a new software tool called Primer-BLAST to alleviate the difficulty in designing target-specific primers. This tool combines BLAST with a global alignment algorithm to ensure a full primer-target alignment and is sensitive enough to detect targets that have a significant number of mismatches to primers. Primer-BLAST allows users to design new target-specific primers in one step as well as to check the specificity of pre-existing primers. Primer-BLAST also supports placing primers based on exon/intron locations and excluding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites in primers.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe a robust and fully implemented general purpose primer design tool that designs target-specific PCR primers. Primer-BLAST offers flexible options to adjust the specificity threshold and other primer properties. This tool is publicly available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a previous paper, we introduced MUSCLE, a new program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences, giving a brief summary of the algorithm and showing MUSCLE to achieve the highest scores reported to date on four alignment accuracy benchmarks. Here we present a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing several previously unpublished techniques that improve biological accuracy and / or computational complexity. We introduce a new option, MUSCLE-fast, designed for high-throughput applications. We also describe a new protocol for evaluating objective functions that align two profiles.
RESULTS: We compare the speed and accuracy of MUSCLE with CLUSTALW, Progressive POA and the MAFFT script FFTNS1, the fastest previously published program known to the author. Accuracy is measured using four benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and SMART. We test three variants that offer highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings), highest speed (MUSCLE-fast), and a carefully chosen compromise between the two (MUSCLE-prog). We find MUSCLE-fast to be the fastest algorithm on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to CLUSTALW in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude less. MUSCLE-fast is able to align 1,000 sequences of average length 282 in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer.
CONCLUSIONS: MUSCLE offers a range of options that provide improved speed and / or alignment accuracy compared with currently available programs. MUSCLE is freely available at http://www.drive5.com/muscle.},

	abstract = {The phylogenetic relationships of Microhylidae, the third largest family of extant frogs, have been difficult to resolve. In the past decade, large amounts of sequence data have been deposited for almost every microhylid genus, but no study has attempted to combine these data to reconstruct a comprehensive phylogeny for this family. In this study, we sequenced 20 near-complete or partial microhylid mitochondrial genomes and integrated them with all available sequences of Microhylidae from GenBank to construct a supermatrix containing 121 genes (14 mitochondrial and 107 nuclear protein-coding genes). The combined dataset is 112,328 characters long (average sequence data length per species = 7829 bp), includes 427 microhylid taxa, and covers all but three genera of the entire family. This dataset provides strong support for the traditional classification of 11 nominal subfamilies and improves the phylogenetic resolution of the relationships among subfamilies. The African subfamily Phrynomerinae is the sister group of all the other microhylids, and the African subfamily Hoplophryninae is the sister taxon to a clade comprising the remaining 9 subfamilies. At the genus level, our analyses confirm the monophyly of most but not all microhylid genera. In summary, we present a new large-scale phylogeny of microhylid frogs that should be valuable for addressing their classification and for comparative evolutionary studies.},

	abstract = {Asterophryinae is a large monophyletic subfamily of Anurans containing over 300 species distributed across one of the world's most geologically active areas - New Guinea and its satellite islands, Australia and the Philippines. The tremendous ecological and morphological diversity of this clade, with apparent specializations for burrowing, terrestrial, semi-aquatic, and arboreal lifestyle, suggests an evolutionary process of adaptive radiation. Despite this spectacular diversity, this and many other questions of evolutionary processes have received little formal study because until now the phylogeny of this spececies-rich clade has remained uncertain. Here we reconstruct a phylogeny for Asterophryinae with greatly increased taxon and genetic sampling relative to prior studies. We use Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference methods to produce the most robust and comprehensive phylogeny to date containing 155 species using 3 nuclear and 2 mitochondrial loci. We also perform a time calibration analysis to estimate the age of the clade. We find support for the monophyly of Asterophryinae as well as need for taxonomic reclassification of several genera. Furthermore, we find increased rates of speciation across the clade supporting the hypothesis of rapid radiation. Lastly, we found that adding taxa to the analysis produced more robust phylogenetic results over adding loci.},

	abstract = {{There is a lack of consensus on how next-generation sequence (NGS) data
   should be considered for phylogenetic and phylogeographic estimates,
   with some studies excluding loci with missing data, whereas others
   include them, even when sequences are missing from a large number of
   individuals. Here, we use simulations, focusing specifically on RAD
   (Restriction site Associated DNA) sequences, to highlight some of the
   unforeseen consequence of excluding missing data from next-generation
   sequencing. Specifically, we show that in addition to the obvious
   effects associated with reducing the amount of data used to make
   historical inferences, the decisions we make about missing data (such as
   the minimum number of individuals with a sequence for a locus to be
   included in the study) also impact the types of loci sampled for a
   study. In particular, as the tolerance for missing data becomes more
   stringent, the mutational spectrum represented in the sampled loci
   becomes truncated such that loci with the highest mutation rates are
   disproportionately excluded. This effect is exacerbated further by
   factors involved in the preparation of the genomic library (i.e., the
   use of reduced representation libraries, as well as the coverage) and
   the taxonomic diversity represented in the library (i.e., the level of
   divergence among the individuals). We demonstrate that the intuitive
   appeals about being conservative by removing loci may be misguided.}},

	abstract = {{Despite considerable progress in unravelling the phylogenetic
   relationships of microhylid frogs, relationships among subfamilies
   remain largely unstable and many genera are not demonstrably
   monophyletic. Here, we used five alternative combinations of DNA
   sequence data (ranging from seven loci for 48 taxa to up to 73 loci for
   as many as 142 taxa) generated using the anchored phylogenomics
   sequencing method (66 loci, derived from conserved genome regions, for
   48 taxa) and Sanger sequencing (seven loci for up to 142 taxa) to tackle
   this problem. We assess the effects of character sampling, taxon
   sampling, analytical methods and assumptions in phylogenetic inference
   of microhylid frogs. The phylogeny of microhylids shows high
   susceptibility to different analytical methods and datasets used for the
   analyses. Clades inferred from maximum-likelihood are generally more
   stable across datasets than those inferred from parsimony. Parsimony
   trees inferred within a tree-alignment framework are generally better
   resolved and better supported than those inferred within a
   similarity-alignment framework, even under the same cost matrix (equally
   weighted) and same treatment of gaps (as a fifth nucleotide state). We
   discuss potential causes for these differences in resolution and clade
   stability among discovery operations. We also highlight the problem that
   commonly used algorithms for model-based analyses do not explicitly
   model insertion and deletion events (i.e. gaps are treated as missing
   data). Our results corroborate the monophyly of Microhylidae and most
   currently recognized subfamilies but fail to provide support for

   from each other solely on the basis of whether the alary processes of

   continuously between two extremes. The horizontal orientation of the

	abstract = {{Background: Over the last ten years we have seen great efforts focused
   on revising amphibian systematics. Phylogenetic reconstructions derived
   from DNA sequence data have played a central role in these revisionary
   studies but have typically under-sampled the diverse frog family
   Microhylidae. Here, we present a detailed phylogenetic study focused on
   expanding previous hypotheses of relationships within this cosmopolitan
   family. Specifically, we placed an emphasis on assessing relationships
   among New World genera and those taxa with uncertain phylogenetic
   affinities (i.e., incertae sedis).
   Results: One mitochondrial and three nuclear genes (about 2.8 kb) were
   sequenced to assess phylogenetic relationships. We utilized an
   unprecedented sampling of 200 microhylid taxa representing 91\% of
   currently recognized subfamilies and 95\% of New World genera. Our
   analyses do not fully resolve relationships among subfamilies supporting
   previous studies that have suggested a rapid early diversification of
   this clade. We observed a close relationship between Synapturanus and
   Otophryne of the subfamily Otophryninae. Within the subfamily
   Gastrophryninae relationships between genera were well resolved.
   Conclusion: Otophryninae is distantly related to all other New World
   microhylids that were recovered as a monophyletic group,
   Gastrophryninae. Within Gastrophryninae, five genera were recovered as
   non-monophyletic; we propose taxonomic re-arrangements to render all
   genera monophyletic. This hypothesis of relationships and updated
   classification for New World microhylids may serve as a guide to better
   understand the evolutionary history of this group that is apparently
   subject to convergent morphological evolution and chromosome reduction.
   Based on a divergence analysis calibrated with hypotheses from previous
   studies and fossil data, it appears that microhylid genera inhabiting
   the New World originated during a period of gradual cooling from the
   late Oligocene to mid Miocene.}},

   converging Australian and Pacific plate boundary zone. It is arguably
   one of the most tectonically complex regions of the world, and its

   dynamics to evaluate the Cenozoic tectonic evolution of New Guinea.
   Future research opportunities to resolve the mantle structure beneath
   New Guinea will enable mantle dynamics to be linked to lithospheric and

@article{Pyron:2011,
	abstract = {{The extant amphibians are one of the most diverse radiations of
   terrestrial vertebrates (>6800 species). Despite much recent focus on
   their conservation, diversification, and systematics, no previous
   phylogeny for the group has contained more than 522 species. However,
   numerous studies with limited taxon sampling have generated large
   amounts of partially overlapping sequence data for many species. Here,
   we combine these data and produce a novel estimate of extant amphibian
   phylogeny, containing 2871 species (similar to 40\% of the known extant
   species) from 432 genera (similar to 85\% of the similar to 500
   currently recognized extant genera). Each sampled species contains up to
   12,712 bp from 12 genes (three mitochondrial, nine nuclear), with an
   average of 2563 bp per species. This data set provides strong support
   for many groups recognized in previous studies, but it also suggests
   non-monophyly for several currently recognized families, particularly in
   hyloid frogs (e.g., Ceratophryidae, Cycloramphidae, Leptodactylidae,
   Strabomantidae). To correct these and other problems, we provide a
   revised classification of extant amphibians for taxa traditionally
   delimited at the family and subfamily levels. This new taxonomy includes
   several families not recognized in current classifications (e.g.,
   Alsodidae, Batrachylidae, Rhinodermatidae, Odontophrynidae,
   Telmatobiidae), but which are strongly supported and important for
   avoiding non-monophyly of current families. Finally, this study provides
   further evidence that the supermatrix approach provides an effective
   strategy for inferring large-scale phylogenies using the combined
   results of previous studies, despite many taxa having extensive missing
   data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

@article{Heath:2008,
	abstract = {{Appropriate and extensive taxon sampling is one of the most important
   determinants of accurate phylogenetic estimation. In addition, accuracy
   of inferences about evolutionary processes obtained from phylogenetic
   analyses is improved significantly by thorough taxon sampling efforts.
   Many recent efforts to improve phylogenetic estimates have focused
   instead on increasing sequence length or the number of overall
   characters in the analysis, and this often does have a beneficial effect
   on the accuracy of phylogenetic analyses. However, phylogenetic analyses
   of few taxa (but each represented by many characters) can be subject to
   strong systematic biases, which in turn produce high measures of
   repeatability (such as bootstrap proportions) in support of incorrect or
   misleading phylogenetic results. Thus, it is important for
   phylogeneticists to consider both the sampling of taxa, as well as the
   sampling of characters, in designing phylogenetic studies. Taxon
   sampling also improves estimates of evolutionary parameters derived from
   phylogenetic trees, and is thus important for improved applications of
   phylogenetic analyses. Analysis of sensitivity to taxon inclusion, the
   possible effects of long-branch attraction, and sensitivity of parameter
   estimation for model-based methods should be a part of any careful and
   thorough phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, recent improvements in
   phylogenetic algorithms and in computational power have removed many
   constraints on analyzing large, thoroughly sampled data sets. Thorough
   taxon sampling is thus one of the most practical ways to improve the
   accuracy of phylogenetic estimates, as well as the accuracy of
   biological inferences that are based on these phylogenetic trees.}},

@article{Bouckaert:2019,
	abstract = {Elaboration of Bayesian phylogenetic inference methods has continued at pace in recent years with major new advances in nearly all aspects of the joint modelling of evolutionary data. It is increasingly appreciated that some evolutionary questions can only be adequately answered by combining evidence from multiple independent sources of data, including genome sequences, sampling dates, phenotypic data, radiocarbon dates, fossil occurrences, and biogeographic range information among others. Including all relevant data into a single joint model is very challenging both conceptually and computationally. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments. Developing such software frameworks is increasingly a major scientific activity in its own right, and comes with specific challenges, from practical software design, development and engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual modelling challenges. BEAST 2 is one such computational software platform, and was first announced over 4 years ago. Here we describe a series of major new developments in the BEAST 2 core platform and model hierarchy that have occurred since the first release of the software, culminating in the recent 2.5 release.},

   episodes throughout most of the Mesozoic and early Tertiary. However,
   long-term gradual diversification is difficult to reconcile with the
   sensitivity of present-day amphibian faunas to rapid ecological changes
   and the incidence of similar environmental perturbations in the past
   that have been associated with high turnover rates in other land
   vertebrates. To provide a comprehensive overview of the history of
   amphibian diversification, we constructed a phylogenetic timetree based
   on a multigene data set of 3.75 kb for 171 species. Our analyses reveal
   several episodes of accelerated amphibian diversification, which do not
   fit models of gradual lineage accumulation. Global turning points in the
   phylogenetic and ecological diversification occurred after the
   end-Permian mass extinction and in the late Cretaceous. Fluctuations in
   amphibian diversification show strong temporal correlation with turnover
   rates in amniotes and the rise of angiosperm-dominated forests.
   Approximately 86\% of modern frog species and > 81\% of salamander

@article{Bergsten:2005,
	abstract = {{The history of long-branch attraction, and in particular methods
   suggested to detect and avoid the artifact to date, is reviewed. Methods
   suggested to avoid LBA-artifacts include excluding long-branch taxa,
   excluding faster evolving third codon positions, using inference methods
   less sensitive to LBA such as likelihood, the Aguinaldo et al. approach,
   sampling more taxa to break up long branches and sampling more
   characters especially of another kind, and the pros and cons of these
   are discussed. Methods suggested to detect LBA are numerous and include
   methodological disconcordance, RASA, separate partition analyses,
   parametric simulation, random outgroup sequences, long-branch
   extraction, split decomposition and spectral analysis. Less than 10
   years ago it was doubted if LBA occurred in real datasets. Today,
   examples are numerous in the literature and it is argued that the
   development of methods to deal with the problem is warranted. A 16 kbp
   dataset of placental mammals and a morphological and molecular combined
   dataset of gall wasps are used to illustrate the particularly common
   problem of LBA of problematic ingroup taxa to outgroups. The preferred
   methods of separate partition analysis, methodological disconcordance,
   and long branch extraction are used to demonstrate detection methods. It
   is argued that since outgroup taxa almost always represent long branches
   and are as such a hazard towards misplacing long branched ingroup taxa,
   phylogenetic analyses should always be run with and without the
   outgroups included. This will detect whether only the outgroup roots the
   ingroup or if it simultaneously alters the ingroup topology, in which
   case previous studies have shown that the latter is most often the
   worse. Apart from that LBA to outgroups is the major and most common
   problem; scanning the literature also detected the ill advised comfort
   of high support values from thousands of characters, but very few taxa,
   in the age of genomics. Taxon sampling is crucial for an accurate
   phylogenetic estimate and trust cannot be put on whole mitochondrial or
   chloroplast genome studies with only a few taxa, despite their high
   support values. The placental mammal example demonstrates that parsimony
   analysis will be prone to LBA by the attraction of the tenrec to the
   distant marsupial outgroups. In addition, the murid rodents, creating
   the classic ``the guinea-pig is not a rodent{''} hypothesis in 1996, are
   also shown to be attracted to the outgroup by nuclear genes, although
   including the morphological evidence for rodents and Glires overcomes
   the artifact. The gall wasp example illustrates that Bayesian analyses
   with a partition-specific GTR + Gamma + I model give a conflicting
   resolution of clades, with a posterior probability of 1.0 when comparing
   ingroup alone versus outgroup rooted topologies, and this is due to
   long-branch attraction to the outgroup. (c) The Willi Hermig Society

@article{Guindon:2003,
	abstract = {{The increase in the number of large data sets and the complexity of
   current probabilistic sequence evolution models necessitates fast and
   reliable phylogeny reconstruction methods. We describe a new approach,
   based on the maximum-likelihood principle, which clearly satisfies these
   requirements. The core of this method is a simple hill-climbing
   algorithm that adjusts tree topology and branch lengths simultaneously.
   This algorithm starts from an initial tree built by a fast
   distance-based method and modifies this tree to improve its likelihood
   at each iteration. Due to this simultaneous adjustment of the topology
   and branch lengths, only a few iterations are sufficient to reach an
   optimum. We used extensive and realistic computer simulations to show
   that the topological accuracy of this new method is at least as high as
   that of the existing maximum-likelihood programs and much higher than
   the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches. The
   reduction of computing time is dramatic in comparison with other
   maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood maximization ability
   tends to be higher. For example, only 12 min were required on a standard
   personal computer to analyze a data set consisting of 500 rbcL sequences
   with 1,428 base pairs from plant plastids, thus reaching a speed of the
   same order as some popular distance-based and parsimony algorithms. This
   new method is implemented in the PHYML program, which is freely

@article{Kessler:2002,
	abstract = {{Aim Little is known about the elevational gradient of plant endemism. It
   is mostly assumed that patterns are determined by topographical factors
   such as area of elevational belts and degree of habitat fragmentation,
   but comparative studies of different plant taxa along the same
   elevational gradient are lacking. The aim was to compare the elevational
   patterns of plant endemism of the entire flora and selected families and
   genera in a search for commonalities.
   Methods The elevational patterns of endemism for the entire Ecuadorean
   vascular plant flora, for twenty-seven selected families, and for
   twenty-four selected genera based on the Catalogue of Vascular Plants of
   Ecuador were analysed.
   Results Elevational patterns of endemism were non-random at all
   taxonomic levels but there was no common elevational pattern. Rather,
   the study groups showed a wide variety of independent patterns at all
   taxonomic levels. Most groups had hump-shaped patterns with maxima at
   different elevations and mostly at the same or at higher elevations than
   the maxima of species richness. The overall flora showed highest
   endemism in the narrowest and most fragmented elevational belts,
   presumably because of the consequent fragmentation of species
   populations.
   Main conclusions Patterns of endemism appear to be influenced both by
   taxon-specific ecological traits (e.g. life form, reproduction,
   dispersal, demography, spatial population structure, competitive
   ability) in their specific interaction with historical processes and by
   environmental factors such as topographical fragmentation. The degree to
   which these influences become visible along the elevational gradient are
   determined by which combination of species is analysed: for a given
   genus or family, taxon-specific traits dominate the patterns, for the
   entire flora taxon-specific patterns are blurred by averaging and the
   signal of topography emerges. Beyond the elevational gradient as such,
   this study shows that the frequently stated assumption that given
   biogeographical settings lead to similar patterns of endemism among
   different taxa is wrong.}},

@article{Zwickl:2002,
	abstract = {{Several authors have argued recently that extensive taxon sampling has a
   positive and important effect on the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates.
   However, other authors have argued that there is little benefit of
   extensive taxon sampling, and so phylogenetic problems can or should be
   reduced to a few exemplar taxa as a means of reducing the computational
   complexity of the phylogenetic analysis. In this paper we examined five
   aspects of study design that may have led to these different
   perspectives. First, we considered the measurement of phylogenetic error
   across a wide range of taxon sample sizes, and conclude that the
   expected error based on randomly selecting trees (which varies by taxon
   sample size) must be considered in evaluating error in studies of the
   effects of taxon sampling. Second, we addressed the scope of the
   phylogenetic problems defined by different samples of taxa, and argue
   that phylogenetic scope needs to be considered in evaluating the
   importance of taxon-sampling strategies. Third, we examined the claim
   that fast and simple tree searches are as effective as more thorough
   searches at finding near-optimal trees that minimize error. We show that
   a more complete search of tree space reduces phylogenetic error,
   especially as the taxon sample size increases. Fourth, we examined the
   effects of simple versus complex simulation models on taxonomic sampling
   studies. Although benefits of taxon sampling are apparent for all
   models, data generated under more complex models of evolution produce
   higher overall levels of error and show greater positive effects of
   increased taxon sampling. Fifth, we asked if different phylogenetic
   optimality criteria show different effects of taxon sampling. Although
   we found strong differences in effectiveness of different optimality
   criteria as a function of taxon sample size, increased taxon sampling
   improved the results from all the common optimality criteria.
   Nonetheless, the method that showed the lowest overall performance
   (minimum evolution) also showed the least improvement from increased
   taxon sampling. Taking each of these results into account re-enforces
   the conclusion that increased sampling of taxa is one of the most
   important ways to increase overall phylogenetic accuracy.}},

@article{Losos:2000,
	abstract = {{Large islands typically have more species than comparable smaller
   islands. Ecological theories, the most influential being the equilibrium
   theory of island biogeography(1), explain the species-area relationship
   as the outcome of the effect of area on immigration and extinction
   rates. However, these theories do not apply to taxa on land masses,
   including continents and large islands, that generate most of their
   species in situ. In this case, species-area relationships should be
   driven by higher speciation rates in larger areas(2-6), a theory that
   has never been quantitatively tested. Here we show that Anolis lizards
   on Caribbean islands meet several expectations of the evolutionary
   theory. Within-island speciation exceeds immigration as a source of new
   species on all islands larger than 3,000 km(2), whereas speciation is
   rare on smaller islands. Above this threshold island size, the rate of
   species proliferation increases with island area, a process that results
   principally from the positive effects of area on speciation rate. Also
   as expected, the slope of the species-area relationship jumps sharply
   above the threshold. Although Anolis lizards have been present on large
   Caribbean islands for over 30 million years, there are indications that
   the current number of species still falls below the

   the sense that the topology is identifiable from knowledge of the joint
   distribution of character states at pairs of terminal nodes of the tree.
   Also, the method of maximum likelihood is statistically consistent for
   inferring the tree topology. In this article we answer the analogous
   questions for reconstructing the full model, including the edge
   transition matrices. Under mild conditions, such full reconstruction is
   achievable, not by using pairs of terminal nodes, but rather by using
   triples of terminal nodes. The identifiability result generalizes
   previous results that were restricted either to characters having two
   states or to transition matrices having special structure. The proof
   develops matrix relationships that may be exploited to identify the
   model. We also use the identifiability result to prove that the method
   of maximum likelihood is consistent for reconstructing the full model.}},

	abstract = {{A 2,479-base pair mitochondrial DNA fragment was sequenced for eight
   chromosome races of Sceloporus grammicus from central Mexico to estimate
   their phylogenetic relationships. The species S. poinsetti and S.
   olivaceus were used separately as alternative outgroups. A total of 795
   positions varied in three complete protein-coding genes examined (ND3,
   ND4L, ND4), and 52 of 292 positions varied across five transfer RNAs
   examined (glycine, argenine, histidine, serine, leucine). Sequence
   divergence values ranged from 0.0 to 0.23 among the ingroup taxa, and a
   maximum of 0.26 was observed between ingroup and outgroup taxa.
   Alternative analyses based upon equally weighted characters and several
   alternative character-weighting options were used to obtain phylogenetic
   hypotheses for the complex, and a single most-parsimonious tree was
   selected from among these on the basis of a new character-weighting
   method that takes into account the observed frequencies of all 12
   possible substitutions for protein genes. The most-parsimonious
   cladogram showed that chromosomal evolution in this complex has been
   more complicated than previously hypothesized. Several rearrangements
   (Robertsonian fissions) have evolved independently on two or more
   occasions, which corroborates evidence from other studies showing that
   single rearrangements are not underdominant upon their origin, and their
   fixation probabilities are enhanced by repeated origins. These
   observations refute expectations of some general models of chromosome
   evolution. The same phylogenetic hypothesis was used to test the
   minimum-interaction model of chromosome evolution and a specific model
   for the evolution of macrochromosome 2. A clear distinction was also
   possible among alternative hypotheses of relationship for three
   chromosome races involved in hybridization, and the consequences for the
   role of chromosomal rearrangements in reducing gene now are discussed in
   this context.}},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

@incollection{Cloos:2005,
	abstract = {{ The spine of the island of New Guinea, the Central Range, is a 1300 km long by 100 to 150 km wide mountain belt with numerous peaks over 3 km elevation. This mountain belt began to form when the Australian passive margin entered a north-dipping subduction zone in the Middle Miocene. Regional relationships and fieldwork near the Ertsberg (Gunung Bijih) mining district in the western Central Range are the basis for making a detailed reconstruction of the events leading up to, and during, collisional orogenesis. Most of New Guinea can be divided into five lithotectonic belts. From north to south, these are an accreted arc terrane, an upturned forearc basement, an underlying metamorphic belt, a highlands fold-and-thrust belt, and a foreland basin. In western New Guinea, the accreted arc/forearc is the northwestern end of the Melanesian Arc Terrane that was the product of two phases of subduction volcanism since the Eocene. This terrane is largely buried under debris shed northwards from the Central Range. The crystalline leading edge of the accreted arc/forearc terrane, the Irian Ophiolite Belt of Jurassic age, is upturned forearc basement forming the north flank of the Central Range. The ophiolite is underlain by the Ruffaer Metamorphic Belt, which comprises continental rise and slope sediments and probably some trench axis deposits that underwent subduction deformation and metamorphism since the Early Miocene. The metamorphic belt grades into the highlands fold-and-thrust belt, which contains carbonate shelf strata at least as young as 15 Ma. Kilometer-scale, angular to rounded folds are the dominant structures. Regional sedimentologic relationships indicate the highlands area has constituted a 500+ km long landmass since ca. 12 Ma. The southern flank of the western Central Range is a giant 300 km long by 30 km wide basement block that has been thrust southwards since 8 Ma, forming the Mapenduma anticline. Minor, but widely distributed, magmatism occurred along the spine of the western highlands from ca. 7.5 to 2.5 Ma. There is abundant evidence for minor left-lateral strike-slip faulting subparallel to the upturned bedding that was concurrent with igneous activity at 4--3 Ma. These relationships, combined with consideration of the mechanical properties of the crust and lithospheric mantle, are the basis for the construction of a series of lithospheric-scale cross sections illustrating the process of collisional delamination. Subduction tectonism and metamorphism began at ca. 30 Ma. Underthrusting of Australian continental margin sediments was well under way by ca. 15 Ma, when small isolated islands emerged. Bulldozing of the sediment cover formed an elongate landmass by ca. 12 Ma, and siliciclastic sediment was shed southwards, overwhelming carbonate shelf sedimentation. Collisional orogenesis due to the jamming of the subduction zone and initiation of thick-skinned crust-involved deformation began at ca. 8 Ma. Magma generation due to asthenospheric upwelling and decompression of stretched lithospheric mantle occurred from ca. 7.5 to 3 Ma. Contractional deformation in the western highlands ended at ca. 4 Ma, when this region became a site of minor northwest-striking, left-lateral strike-slip faulting. Since ca. 2 Ma, offset has been localized along the Yapen fault zone near the north coast of the island. Collisional delamination involved the decapitation of the crust, continued sinking of the subducted lithosphere, and the upwelling of asthenosphere into the rupture as fast as it separated. This ensuing adiabatic decompression melting manifested itself as a short-lived magmatic event and up to 2.5 km of vertical uplift, both centered on the spine of the collision-generated orogenic belt. Collisional orogenesis is still under way beneath the eastern Central Range, with delamination-generated magmatism in its waning stages. Starting at ca. 8 Ma, the tear rupturing the subducting Australian lithosphere propagated from west to east at a rate of ∼150 km/m.y. }},

	abstract = {Abstract Based on morphological, anatomical, ecological, ethological, and molecular traits, two new genera of microhylid frogs from mainland New Guinea are described. Metamagnusia gen. n. includes two species, M. marani sp. n., the type species found in the Wondiwoi Mountains at the base of the Wandammen Peninsula (Papua Province, Indonesia), and M. slateri (Loveridge, 1955) comb. n., from eastern New Guinea (Papua New Guinea). The second new genus, Pseudocallulops gen. n., also includes two species, P. eurydactylus (Zweifel, 1972) comb. n. from the Fakfak Mountains on the Bomberai Peninsula (Papua Province, Indonesia), and P. pullifer (G{\"u}nther, 2006) comb. n., which is designated as the type species and which occurs in the Wondiwoi Mountains at the base of the Wandammen Peninsula. Both new genera belong to the group of asterophryine genera with a symphignathine state of the maxillary bones. Metamagnusia gen. n. is most closely related to the genus Asterophrys, while Pseudocallulops gen. n. forms a sister-clade of the taxa Asterophrys + Metamagnusia. The new genera are erected to recognize their differences in fundamental traits from the presently recognized genera. Another goal was to dissolve polyphyletic taxa and to avoid creation of paraphyletic taxa within the symphignathine genera of the Australopapuan microhylids.

	abstract = {{Large phylogenomics data sets require fast tree inference methods, especially for maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenies. Fast programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented.

	abstract = {The family Microhylidae has a large circumtropic distribution and contains about 400 species in a highly subdivided taxonomy. Relationships among its constituent taxa remained controversial due to homoplasy in morphological characters, resulting in conflicting phylogenetic hypotheses. A phylogeny based on four nuclear genes (rag-1, rag-2, tyrosinase, BDNF) and one mitochondrial gene (CO1) of representatives of all currently recognized subfamilies uncovers a basal polytomy between several subfamilial clades. A sister group relationship between the cophylines and scaphiophrynines is resolved with moderate support, which unites these endemic Malagasy taxa for the first time. The American members of the subfamily Microhylinae are resolved to form a clade entirely separate from the Asian members of that subfamily. Otophryne is excluded from the subfamily Microhylinae, and resolved as a basal taxon. The placement of the Asian dyscophine Calluella nested within the Asian Microhyline clade rather than with the genus Dyscophus is corroborated by our data. Bayesian estimates of the divergence time of extant Microhylidae (47--90Mya) and among the subclades within the family are discussed in frameworks of alternative possible biogeographic scenarios.},

	abstract = {{Parker (1934) distinguished Sphenophryne from other genera of the Genyophryninae (Sphenophryninae in his work) by its pectoral girdle having a more nearly complete complement of bony and cartilaginous elements. Otherwise, the species he placed there were a diverse lot, including ones adapted for climbing, for living in or on leaf litter, or for a cryptic, even burrowing existence. The characteristics of the pectoral girdle are primitive compared to those of other genyophrynine genera, which have reduced or lost one or more of the elements. Thus, the common possession of a primitive girdle is inadequate as the sole character defining the genus. In the present work I review species with the supposedly diagnostic character of Sphenophryne and recognize four genera: Sphenophryne (monotypic), and three removed from synonymy---Austrochaperina (23 species), Liophryne (6 species), and Oxydactyla (5 species). The characters I use to define the genera are for the most part closely tied to the habits of the species and thus are subject to the criticism that homoplasy rather than synapomorphy is demonstrated. Regardless, the probability that the new arrangement identifies four monophyletic lines is considerably greater than that Sphenophryne, as it has been constituted, is monophyletic.}},

	abstract = {{In phylogenetic analyses of molecular sequence data, partitioning involves estimating independent models of molecular evolution for different sets of sites in a sequence alignment. Choosing an appropriate partitioning scheme is an important step in most analyses because it can affect the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstruction. Despite this, partitioning schemes are often chosen without explicit statistical justification. Here, we describe two new objective methods for the combined selection of best-fit partitioning schemes and nucleotide substitution models. These methods allow millions of partitioning schemes to be compared in realistic time frames and so permit the objective selection of partitioning schemes even for large multilocus DNA data sets. We demonstrate that these methods significantly outperform previous approaches, including both the ad hoc selection of partitioning schemes (e.g., partitioning by gene or codon position) and a recently proposed hierarchical clustering method. We have implemented these methods in an open-source program, PartitionFinder. This program allows users to select partitioning schemes and substitution models using a range of information-theoretic metrics (e.g., the Bayesian information criterion, akaike information criterion [AIC], and corrected AIC). We hope that PartitionFinder will encourage the objective selection of partitioning schemes and thus lead to improvements in phylogenetic analyses. PartitionFinder is written in Python and runs under Mac OSX 10.4 and above. The program, source code, and a detailed manual are freely available from www.robertlanfear.com/partitionfinder.}},

   numbers from the currently described 244 species to a minimum of 373 and
   up to 465. This diversity is widespread geographically and across most
   major phylogenetic lineages except in a few previously well-studied

   classify the genealogical lineages in confirmed and unconfirmed
   candidate species or deeply divergent conspecific lineages based on
   concordance of genetic divergences with other characters. This

@article{Fouquet:2007,
	abstract = {{Background. Amphibians are rapidly vanishing. At the same time, it is
   most likely that the number of amphibian species is highly
   underestimated. Recent DNA barcoding work has attempted to define a
   threshold between intra- and inter-specific genetic distances to help
   identify candidate species. In groups with high extinction rates and
   poorly known species boundaries, like amphibians, such tools may provide
   a way to rapidly evaluate species richness. Methodology. Here we analyse
   published and new 16S rDNA sequences from 60 frog species of
   Amazonia-Guianas to obtain a minimum estimate of the number of
   undescribed species in this region. We combined isolation by distance,
   phylogenetic analyses, and comparison of molecular distances to evaluate
   threshold values for the identification of candidate species among these
   frogs. Principal Findings. In most cases, geographically distant
   populations belong to genetically highly distinct lineages that could be
   considered as candidate new species. This was not universal among the
   taxa studied and thus widespread species of Neotropical frogs really do
   exist, contrary to previous assumptions. Moreover, the many instances of
   paraphyly and the wide overlap between distributions of inter- and
   intra-specific distances reinforce the hypothesis that many cryptic
   species remain to be described. In our data set, pairwise genetic
   distances below 0.02 are strongly correlated with geographical
   distances. This correlation remains statistically significant until
   genetic distance is 0.05, with no such relation thereafter. This
   suggests that for higher distances allopatric and sympatric cryptic
   species prevail. Based on our analyses, we propose a more inclusive
   pairwise genetic distance of 0.03 between taxa to target lineages that
   could correspond to candidate species. Conclusions. Using this approach,
   we identify 129 candidate species, two-fold greater than the 60 species
   included in the current study. This leads to estimates of around 170 to
   460 frog taxa unrecognized in Amazonia-Guianas. Significance. As a
   consequence the global amphibian decline detected especially in the
   Neotropics may be worse than realised.}},

	abstract = {{I describe a new skink of the genus Lobulia from Mt. Simpson in
   southeasternmost New Guinea. This species differs from all other members
   of the genus in having only three pairs of enlarged chin shields and
   only the first pair in medial contact. It is most similar in scalation
   to L. elegans but is readily distinguished from that species by its
   color pattern, body size and shape, and numbers of lamellae.
   Morphological data on L. elegans have not been reported since the
   description of the holotype in 1897, so I provide a redescription of
   that species based on six specimens-including the holotype-of certain
   conspecificity and from within approximately 100 km of the type locality
   at Mt. Victoria. I also elevate Lygosoma elegantoides lobulus from
   synonymy with Lobulia elegans, from which it is readily distinguished on
   the basis of scalational and color-pattern features. The resurrected L.
   lobulus and the new species from Mt. Simpson represent the seventh and
   eighth recognized species of Lobulia, and the Mt. Simpson species is the
   fifth member of the Papuan herpetofauna that is apparently endemic to
   Mt. Simpson. Mt. Simpson appears to be a moderate center of local
   endemism within southeastern New Guinea.}},

@book{Zweiful:1980,
	abstract = {"The Huon Peninsula forms the eastern end of the Finisterre-Saruwaged mountainous region, nearly 300 km. long, which rises to 4000 m. above the sea and nearly that far above adjacent lowlands. Thirty-eight species of frogs and 52 of lizards are recorded from the peninsula, many of them for the first time. Endemism is slight: none of the lizards and only three of the frog species appear to be endemic. Most of the lizards (92%) and frogs (54% of non-endemic species) are lowland forms, although many of these range into uplands as well. Populations of four species of lizards and 16 of frogs evidently are disjunct from conspecific populations elsewhere, almost all of which are in mountains to the southwest of the Peninsula, across the Ramu-Markham River Valley. The disjunct species are ones with lower elevational limits at about 1000-1400 m., some lower. Frog species restricted to high mountain forests or grasslands elsewhere in New Guinea are absent from the Peninsula. Geological evidence indicates that the mountain mass of which the Huon Peninsula is part has undergone 3000 m. of uplift since the late Pliocene, and that for part of its existence the area was insular. In the Pleistocene, glaciers existed on the highest peaks, montane grassland expanded and cooler temperatures prevailed. It is hypothesized that these altered climatic conditions permitted immigration of such upland species as are present and now, with changed climate, exist in disjunct populations. Climate did not charge sufficiently to permit immigration of high montane species. Lowland species--especially skinks--would have become established shortly after the land mass first appeared above the sea, and the more balanced lowland fauna would have been achieved when the Ramu-Markham area became dry land. The scarcity of endemic forms suggests that the Finisterre-Saruwaged region has not been isolated long enough or continuously enough to permit speciation of isolated populations. The frog and lizard faunas provide no evidence of a former land connection between New Britain and the Huon Peninsula, and the scarcity of lowland New Guinea frog species in New Britain argues against any such connection. One new species of microhylid frog--Cophixalus pipilans--is described, and distributional, ecological, and systematic notes are given for many of the species"--P. 390.},

	abstract = {{The study of interspecific variation in plant ecological strategies has
   revealed suites of traits associated with leaf life span and with
   maximum levels of water deficit (measured as leaf water potentials).
   Here, the relationship between these sets of traits was examined in a
   study of 20 co-occurring chaparral shrubs that vary in leaf habit,
   rooting depth, and regeneration strategies. Leaf life span (LLS) and
   minimum seasonal water potentials (psi(min)) were not significantly
   correlated, suggesting that they are associated with independent aspects
   of functional variation. Multiple regression analyses of a large suite
   of physiological, functional, and phenological attributes in relation to
   these two ``anchor traits{''} supported this view. Short LLS was
   significantly associated with high specific leaf area, hi-h carbon
   assimilation and leaf nitrogen (per mass), early onset of growth, and a
   multistemmed, short stature growth form. This suite of traits was also
   associated with opportunistic regeneration following physical
   disturbance. Area-based gas exchange was not tightly linked to LLS. Low
   psi(min) (i.e., greater water deficit) was associated with high wood
   density, small vessel diameters, thin twigs, low leaf area: sapwood area
   ratios, and early onset of leaf abscission. Among the evergreen species,
   this suite of traits was most characteristic of post-fire seeders, which
   depend on high drought tolerance for post-fire regeneration of
   seedlings. Plant stature was the only trait associated with both the LLS
   axis and the psi(min) axis of functional variation. A two-dimensional
   strategy space, approximately defined by LLS and psi(min), can be used
   to distinguish contrasting strategies of drought tolerance vs.
   avoidance, and alternative modes of regeneration following fire and
   other disturbance. This conceptual scheme illustrates the strength of a
   trait-based approach to defining plant strategies in relation to
   resource availability and disturbance.}},

However, existing methods either use summary statistics (gene trees) to carry out estimation, ignoring an important source of variability in the estimates, or involve computationally intensive Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that do not scale well to whole-genome datasets. Results: We develop a method to infer relationships among quartets of taxa under the coalescent model using techniques from algebraic statistics. Uncertainty in the estimated relationships is quantified using the nonparametric bootstrap. The performance of our method is assessed with simulated data. We then describe how our method could be used for species tree inference in larger taxon samples, and demonstrate its utility using datasets for Sistrurus rattlesnakes and for soybeans.},

	abstract = {Until recently, it has been common practice for a phylogenetic analysis to use a single gene sequence from a single individual organism as a proxy for an entire species. With technological advances, it is now becoming more common to collect data sets containing multiple gene loci and multiple individuals per species. These data sets often reveal the need to directly model intraspecies polymorphism and incomplete lineage sorting in phylogenetic estimation procedures.For a single species, coalescent theory is widely used in contemporary population genetics to model intraspecific gene trees. Here, we present a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method for the multispecies coalescent. Our method coestimates multiple gene trees embedded in a shared species tree along with the effective population size of both extant and ancestral species. The inference is made possible by multilocus data from multiple individuals per species.Using a multiindividual data set and a series of simulations of rapid species radiations, we demonstrate the efficacy of our new method. These simulations give some insight into the behavior of the method as a function of sampled individuals, sampled loci, and sequence length. Finally, we compare our new method to both an existing method (BEST 2.2) with similar goals and the supermatrix (concatenation) method. We demonstrate that both BEST and our method have much better estimation accuracy for species tree topology than concatenation, and our method outperforms BEST in divergence time and population size estimation.},

@article{Liu:2010,
	abstract = {Background: Several phylogenetic approaches have been developed to estimate species trees from collections of gene trees. However, maximum likelihood approaches for estimating species trees under the coalescent model are limited. Although the likelihood of a species tree under the multispecies coalescent model has already been derived by Rannala and Yang, it can be shown that the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the species tree (topology, branch lengths, and population sizes) from gene trees under this formula does not exist. In this paper, we develop a pseudo-likelihood function of the species tree to obtain maximum pseudo-likelihood estimates (MPE) of species trees, with branch lengths of the species tree in coalescent units. Results: We show that the MPE of the species tree is statistically consistent as the number M of genes goes to infinity. In addition, the probability that the MPE of the species tree matches the true species tree converges to 1 at rate O(M-1). The simulation results confirm that the maximum pseudo-likelihood approach is statistically consistent even when the species tree is in the anomaly zone. We applied our method, Maximum Pseudo-likelihood for Estimating Species Trees (MP-EST) to a mammal dataset. The four major clades found in the MP-EST tree are consistent with those in the Bayesian concatenation tree. The bootstrap supports for the species tree estimated by the MP-EST method are more reasonable than the posterior probability supports given by the Bayesian concatenation method in reflecting the level of uncertainty in gene trees and controversies over the relationship of four major groups of placental mammals. Conclusions: MP-EST can consistently estimate the topology and branch lengths (in coalescent units) of the species tree. Although the pseudo-likelihood is derived from coalescent theory, and assumes no gene flow or horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the MP-EST method is robust to a small amount of HGT in the dataset. In addition, increasing the number of genes does not increase the computational time substantially. The MP-EST method is fast for analyzing datasets that involve a large number of genes but a moderate number of species. {\textcopyright} 2010 Liu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

According to external morphology and osteological characters, it is most closely related to Xenorhina, but according to molecular data (mitochondrial DNA), it is most closely related to the genera Asterophrys, Metamagnusia, and Pseudocallulops.

@article{Bollback:2006,
	abstract = {Character mapping on phylogenies has played an important, if not critical role, in our understanding of molecular, morphological, and behavioral evolution. Until very recently we have relied on parsimony to infer character changes. Parsimony has a number of serious limitations that are drawbacks to our understanding. Recent statistical methods have been developed that free us from these limitations enabling us to overcome the problems of parsimony by accommodating uncertainty in evolutionary time, ancestral states, and the phylogeny. SIMMAP has been developed to implement stochastic character mapping that is useful to both molecular evolutionists, systematists, and bioinformaticians. Researchers can address questions about positive selection, patterns of amino acid substitution, character association, and patterns of morphological evolution. Stochastic character mapping, as implemented in the SIMMAP software, enables users to address questions that require mapping characters onto phylogenies using a probabilistic approach that does not rely on parsimony. Analyses can be performed using a fully Bayesian approach that is not reliant on considering a single topology, set of substitution model parameters, or reconstruction of ancestral states. Uncertainty in these quantities is accommodated by using MCMC samples from their respective posterior distributions.},

@article{Pigram:1989,
	abstract = {The middle Oligocene collision of the northern margin of the Australian craton with a complex subduction system resulted in emplacement of a thrust mass and formation of a foreland basin that extended from the Coral Sea to the Indian Ocean. The distribution of carbonate-platform facies in southwestern Papua New Guinea reflects the transition from an Eocene passive margin setting to the early stages of foreland basin evolution. The initial basin configuration, with terrigenous sedimentation confined to the proximal foredeep, allowed carbonate deposition in the shallow environment adjacent to the peripheral forebulge. Subsequent southward migration of the basin resulted in a rapid increase in the area and thickness of carbonate-platform deposition. When the proximal foredeep became filled by detritus shed from the emerging orogen, clastic sediments buried the platform and terminated carbonate deposition. The history of the southern Papua New Guinea carbonate platform illustrates the paradox of carbonate deposition within a foreland basin, whereby basin configuration initially encourages thick and extensive carbonate deposition but inevitably leads to terrigenous inundation and the demise of the carbonate platform.},

	abstract = {We provide a new model that explains the timing and location for deposit formation.*Deposit formation is linked to collision events and onset of microplate tectonics.*Six new ages for mineral deposits are provided.A comprehensive database of mines, deposits and prospects is included.
	Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands are in one of the most prospective regions for intrusion-related mineral deposits. However, because of the tectonic complexity of the region and the lack of comprehensive regional geological datasets, the link between mineralization and the regional-scale geodynamic framework has not been understood. Here we present a new model for the metallogenesis of the region based on a synthesis of recent studies on the petrogenesis of magmatic arcs and the history of subduction zones throughout the region, combined with the spatio-temporal distribution of intrusion-related mineral deposits, and six new deposit ages. Convergence at the Pacific-Australia plate boundary was accommodated, from at least 45 Ma, by subduction at the Melanesian trench, with related Melanesian arc magmatism. The arrival of the Ontong Java Plateau at the trench at ca. 26 Ma resulted in cessation of subduction, immediately followed by formation of Cu-Au porphyry-epithermal deposits (at 24--20 Ma) throughout the Melanesian arc. Late Oligocene to early Miocene tectonic reorganization led to initiation of subduction at the Pocklington trough, and onset of magmatism in the Maramuni arc. The arrival of the Australian continent at the Pocklington trough by 12 Ma resulted in continental collision and ore deposit formation (from 12 to 6 Ma). This is represented by Cu-Au porphyry deposits in the New Guinea Orogen, and epithermal Au systems in the Papuan Peninsula. From 6 Ma, crustal delamination in Papua New Guinea, related to the prior Pocklington trough subduction resulted in adiabatic mantle melting with emplacement of diverse Cu and Au porphyry and epithermal deposits within the Papuan Fold and Thrust Belt and Papuan Peninsula from 6 Ma to the present day. Subduction at the New Britain and San Cristobal trenches from ca. 10 Ma resulted in an escalation in tectonic complexity and the onset of microplate tectonics in eastern Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. This is reflected in the formation of diverse and discrete geodynamic settings for mineralization within the recent to modern arc setting, primarily related to upper plate shortening and extension and the spatial relationship to structures within the subducting slab.},
